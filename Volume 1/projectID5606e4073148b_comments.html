<HTML><BODY>A collection of Welsh and Manx folklore in two volumes.

<p>You will encounter significant stretches of Welsh, followed by an English translation ("For the sake of an occasional reader who does not know Welsh..."), using an orthography slightly different from modern Welsh. The Welsh double l is set as a in lowercase as a double letter l with a bar through it, and in upper case with a letter that looks like a capital I directly followed by a capital L (Unicode: &#7931; and &#7930;, modern Welsh ll). We type these as [ll] and [Ll] respectively ([LL] in uppercase context). Further you will encounter the d with bar (Unicode: &#273; and &#272;; modern Welsh dd), we type these as [dd] and [Dd] ([DD] in uppercase context), respectively. 

<p>To clarify this a little, the idea is to use [DD] and [LL] when the following letter is uppercase. We use [Dd] and [Ll] when the following letter is lower-case.

<p>So, we transcribe &#7930;ANFAIR as [LL]ANFAIR and &#7930;anfair as [Ll]anfair.

<p><b>Please use the indicated notation for Welsh letters, as this enables me to
automatically restore those letters in the HTML version. Please do not modernize the orthography to current Welsh.</b>

<p>In this text we will also sometimes encounter the Middle Welsh w, which looks like a 6 with a slightly open loop. (Uppercase: &#7932; and lowercase: &#7933;). Please proof this letter as [W6] and [w6].

<p>Since we have no Wordcheck dictionary for Welsh, you can follow this hint: when proofreading this text, install a Welsh spelling dictionary in your browser, and look extra carefully at all the words not marked by it.

<p>Poetry, when set side-by-side can be set sequentially, with the
left hand side (original Welsh) going on top, and the right hand side (English translation) below.

<p>Fragments in Latin, French, and a few other languages. Some Greek, plenty of footnotes, so above average hard.

<p>Have Fun!
