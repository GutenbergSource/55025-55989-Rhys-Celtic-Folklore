<p class="first">Towards the close of the seventies I began to collect
Welsh folklore. I did so partly because others had set the example
elsewhere, and partly in order to see whether Wales could boast of any
story-tellers of the kind that delight the readers of Campbell&rsquo;s
<i>Popular Tales of the West Highlands</i>. I soon found what I was not
wholly unprepared for, that as a rule I could not get a single story of
any length from the mouths of any of my fellow countrymen, but a
considerable number of bits of stories. In some instances these were so
scrappy that it took me years to discover how to fit them into their
proper context; but, speaking generally, I may say, that, as the
materials, such as they were, accumulated, my initial difficulties
disappeared. I was, however, always a little afraid of refreshing my
memory with the legends of other lands lest I should read into those of
my own, ideas possibly foreign to them. While one is busy collecting,
it is safest probably not to be too much engaged in comparison: when
the work of collecting is done that of comparing may begin. But after
all I have not attempted to proceed very far in that direction, only
just far enough to find elucidation here and there for the meaning of
items of folklore brought under my notice. To have gone further would
have involved me in excursions hopelessly beyond the limits of my
undertaking, for comparative folklore has lately assumed <span class=

"xd26e150">viii</a>]</span>such dimensions, that it seems best to leave
it to those who make it their special study.</p>
<p>It is a cause of genuine regret to me that I did not commence my
inquiries earlier, when I had more opportunities of pursuing them,
especially when I was a village schoolmaster in Anglesey and could have
done the folklore of that island thoroughly; but my education, such as
it was, had been of a nature to discourage all interest in anything
that savoured of heathen lore and superstition. Nor is that all, for
the schoolmasters of my early days took very little trouble to teach
their pupils to keep their eyes open or take notice of what they heard
around them; so I grew up without having acquired the habit of
observing anything, except the Sabbath. It is to be hoped that the
younger generation of schoolmasters trained under more auspicious
circumstances, when the baleful influence of Robert Lowe has given way
to a more enlightened system of public instruction, will do better, and
succeed in fostering in their pupils habits of observation. At all
events there is plenty of work still left to be done by careful
observers and skilful inquirers, as will be seen from the geographical
list showing approximately the provenance of the more important
contributions to the Kymric folklore in this collection: the counties
will be found to figure very unequally. Thus the anglicizing districts
have helped me very little, while the more Welsh county of Carnarvon
easily takes the lead; but I am inclined to regard the anomalous
features of that list as in a great measure due to accident. In other
words, some neighbourhoods have been luckier than others in having
produced or attracted men who paid attention to local folklore; and if
other counties were to be worked equally with Carnarvonshire, some of
them would probably be found <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e154"
href="#xd26e154" name="xd26e154">ix</a>]</span>not much less rich in
their yield. The anglicizing counties in particular are apt to be
disregarded both from the Welsh and the English points of view, in
folklore just as in some other things; and in this connexion I cannot
help mentioning the premature death of the Rev. Elias Owen as a loss
which Welsh folklorists will not soon cease to regret.</p>
<p>My information has been obtained partly viva voce, partly by letter.
In the case of the stories written down for me in Welsh, I may mention
that in some instances the language is far from good; but it has not
been thought expedient to alter it in any way, beyond introducing some
consistency into the spelling. In the case of the longest specimen of
the written stories, Mr. J. C. Hughes&rsquo; Curse of Pantannas, it is
worthy of notice in passing, that the rendering of it into English was
followed by a version in blank verse by Sir Lewis Morris, who published
it in his <i>Songs of Britain</i>. With regard to the work generally,
my original intention was to publish the materials, obtained in the way
described, with such stories already in print as might be deemed
necessary by way of setting for them; and to let any theories or
deductions in which I might be disposed to indulge follow later. In
this way the first six chapters and portions of some of the others
appeared from time to time in the publications of the Honourable
Society of Cymmrodorion and in those of the Folk-Lore Society. This
would have allowed me to divide the present work into the two well
marked sections of materials and deductions. But, when the earlier part
came to be edited, I found that I had a good deal of fresh material at
my disposal, so that the chapters in question had in some instances to
be considerably lengthened and in some others modified in other ways.
Then as to the deductive half of the work, it may be mentioned that
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e161" href="#xd26e161" name=
"xd26e161">x</a>]</span>certain portions of the folklore, though ever
apt to repeat themselves, were found when closely scrutinized to show
serious lacun&aelig;, which had to be filled in the course of the
reasoning suggested by the materials in hand. Thus the idea of the
whole consisting of two distinctly defined sections had to be given up
or else allowed to wait till I should find time to recast it. But I
could no more look forward to any such time than to the eventual
possibility of escaping minor inconsistencies by quietly stepping
through the looking-glass and beginning my work with the index instead
of resting content to make it in the old-fashioned way at the end.
There was, however, a third course, which is only mentioned to be
rejected, and that was to abstain from all further publication; but
what reader of books has ever known any of his authors to adopt
that!</p>
<p>To crown these indiscretions I have to confess that even when most
of what I may call the raw material had been brought together, I had no
clear idea what I was going to do with it; but I had a hazy notion,
that, as in the case of an inveterate talker whose stream of words is
only made the more boisterous by obstruction, once I sat down to write
I should find reasons and arguments flowing in. It may seem as though I
had been secretly conjuring with Vergil&rsquo;s words <i lang=
"la">viresque adquirit eundo</i>. Nothing so deliberate: the world in
which I live swarms with busybodies dying to organize everybody and
everything, and my instinctive opposition to all that order of tyranny
makes me inclined to cherish a somewhat wild sort of free will. Still
the cursory reader would be wrong to take for granted that there is no
method in my madness: should he take the trouble to look for it, he
would find that it has a certain unity of purpose, which has been
worked out in the later chapters; but to spare him that trouble
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e168" href="#xd26e168" name=
"xd26e168">xi</a>]</span>I venture to become my own expositor and to
append the following summary:&mdash;</p>
<p>The materials crowded into the earlier chapters mark out the stories
connected with the fairies, whether of the lakes or of the dry land, as
the richest lode to be exploited in the mine of Celtic folklore. That
work is attempted in the later chapters; and the analysis of what may
briefly be described as the fairy lore given in the earlier ones
carries with it the means of forcing the conviction, that the complex
group of ideas identified with the little people is of more origins
than one; in other words, that it is drawn partly from history and
fact, and partly from the world of imagination and myth. The latter
element proves on examination to be inseparably connected with certain
ancient beliefs in divinities and demons associated, for instance, with
lakes, rivers, and floods. Accordingly, this aspect of fairy lore has
been dealt with in chapters vi and vii: the former is devoted largely
to the materials themselves, while the latter brings the argument to a
conclusion as to the intimate connexion of the fairies with the
water-world. Then comes the turn of the other kind of origin to be
discussed, namely, that which postulates the historical existence of
the fairies as a real race on which have been lavishly superinduced
various impossible attributes. This opens up a considerable vista into
the early ethnology of these islands, and it involves a variety of
questions bearing on the fortunes here of other races. In the series
which suggests itself the fairies come first as the oldest and lowest
people: then comes that which I venture to call Pictish, possessed of a
higher civilization and of warlike instincts. Next come the earlier
Celts of the Goidelic branch, the traces, linguistic and other, of
whose presence in Wales have demanded repeated notice; and last of all
come the other Celts, the linguistic <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e172" href="#xd26e172" name="xd26e172">xii</a>]</span>ancestors of
the Welsh and all the other speakers of Brythonic. The development of
these theses, as far as folklore supplies materials, occupies
practically the remaining five chapters. Among the subsidiary questions
raised may be instanced those of magic and the origin of druidism; not
to mention a neglected aspect of the Arthurian legend, the intimate
association of the Arthur of Welsh folklore and tradition with Snowdon,
and Arthur&rsquo;s attitude towards the Goidelic population in his
time.</p>
<p>Lastly, I have the pleasant duty of thanking all those who have
helped me, whether by word of mouth or by letter, whether by reference
to already printed materials or by assistance in any other way: the
names of many of them will be found recorded in their proper places. As
a rule my inquiries met with prompt replies, and I am not aware that
any difficulties were purposely thrown in my way. Nevertheless I have
had difficulties in abundance to encounter, such as the natural shyness
of some of those whom I wished to examine on the subject of their
recollections, and above all the unavoidable difficulty of
cross-questioning those whose information reached me by post. For the
precise value of any evidence bearing on Celtic folklore is almost
impossible to ascertain, unless it can be made the subject of
cross-examination. This arises from the fact that we Celts have a knack
of thinking ourselves in complete accord with what we fancy to be in
the inquirer&rsquo;s mind, so that we are quite capable of misleading
him in perfect good faith. A most apposite instance, deserving of being
placed on record, came under my notice many years ago. In the summer of
1868 I spent several months in Paris, where I met the historian Henri
Martin more than once. On being introduced to him he reminded me that
he had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e176" href="#xd26e176" name=
"xd26e176">xiii</a>]</span>visited South Wales not long before, and
that he had been delighted to find the peasantry there still believing
in the transmigration of souls. I expressed my surprise, and remarked
that he must be joking. Nothing of the kind, he assured me, as he had
questioned them himself: the fact admitted of no doubt. I expressed
further surprise, but as I perceived that he was proud of the result of
his friendly encounters with my countrymen I never ventured to return
to the subject, though I always wondered what in the world it could
mean. A few years ago, however, I happened to converse with one of the
most charming and accomplished of Welsh ladies, when she chanced to
mention Henri Martin&rsquo;s advent: it turned out that he had visited
Dr. Charles Williams, then the Principal of Jesus College, and that Dr.
Williams introduced him to his friends in South Wales. So M. Martin
arrived among the hospitable friends of the lady talking to me, who had
in fact to act as his interpreter: I never understood that he could
talk much English or any Welsh. Now I have no doubt that M. Martin,
with his fixed ideas about the druids and their teaching, propounded
palpably leading questions for the Welsh people whom he wished to
examine. His fascinating interpreter put them into terse Welsh, and the
whole thing was done. I could almost venture to write out the dialogue,
which gave back to the great Frenchman his own exact notions from the
lips of simple peasants in that subtle non-Aryan syntax, which no Welsh
barrister has ever been able to explain to the satisfaction of a
bewildered English judge trying to administer justice among a people
whom he cannot wholly comprehend.</p>
<p>This will serve to illustrate one of the difficulties with which the
collector of folklore in Wales has <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e180" href="#xd26e180" name="xd26e180">xiv</a>]</span>to cope. I
have done my best to reduce the possible extent of the error to which
it might give rise; and it is only fair to say that those whom I
plagued with my questionings bore the tedium of it with patience, and
that to them my thanks are due in a special degree. Neither they,
however, nor I, could reasonably complain, if we found other
folklorists examining other witnesses on points which had already
occupied us; for in such matters one may say with confidence, that
<i>in the multitude of counsellors there is safety</i>.</p>

<p class="first">The chief object of this and several of the following
chapters is to place on record all the matter I can find on the subject
of Welsh lake legends: what I may have to say of them is merely by the
way and sporadic, and I should feel well paid for my trouble if these
contributions should stimulate others to communicate to the public bits
of similar legends, which, possibly, still linger unrecorded among the
mountains of Wales. For it should be clearly understood that all such
things bear on the history of the Welsh, as the history of no people
can be said to have been written so long as its superstitions and
beliefs in past times have not been studied; and those who may think
that the legends here recorded are childish and frivolous, may rest
assured that they bear on questions which could not themselves be
called either childish or frivolous. So, however silly a legend may be
thought, let him who knows such a legend communicate it to somebody who
will place it on record; he will then probably find that it has more
meaning and interest than he had anticipated. <span class=

<p class="first">I find it best to begin by reproducing a story which
has already been placed on record: this appears desirable on account of
its being the most complete of its kind, and the one with which shorter
ones can most readily be compared. I allude to the legend of the Lady
of &#7930;yn y Fan Fach in Carmarthenshire, which I take the liberty of
copying from Mr. Rees of Tonn&rsquo;s version in the introduction to
<i>The Physicians of My&#273;vai</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2194src" href="#xd26e2194" name="xd26e2194src">1</a>, published
by the Welsh Manuscript Society, at &#7930;andovery, in 1861. There he
says that he wrote it down from the oral recitations, which I suppose
were in Welsh, of John Evans, tiler, of My&#273;fai, David Williams,
Morfa, near My&#273;fai, who was about ninety years old at the time,
and Elizabeth Morgan, of Hen&#7931;ys Lodge, near &#7930;andovery, who
was a native of the same village of My&#273;fai; to this it may be
added that he acknowledges obligations also to Joseph Joseph, Esq.,
F.S.A., Brecon, for collecting particulars from the old inhabitants of
the parish of &#7930;an&#273;eusant. The legend, as given by Mr. Rees
in English, runs as follows, and strongly reminds one in certain parts
of the Story of Undine as given in the German of De la Motte
Fouqu&eacute;, with which it should be compared:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When the eventful struggle made by the Princes of South Wales
to preserve the independence of their country was drawing to its close
in the twelfth century, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb3" href=
"#v1pb3" name="v1pb3">3</a>]</span>there lived at
Blaensaw&#273;e<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2248src" href="#xd26e2248"
name="xd26e2248src">2</a> near &#7930;an&#273;eusant, Carmarthenshire,
a widowed woman, the relict of a farmer who had fallen in those
disastrous troubles.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The widow had an only son to bring up, but Providence smiled
upon her, and despite her forlorn condition, her live stock had so
increased in course of time, that she could not well depasture them
upon her farm, so she sent a portion of her cattle to graze on the
adjoining Black Mountain, and their most favourite place was near the
small lake called &#7930;yn y Fan Fach, on the north-western side of
the Carmarthenshire Fans.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The son grew up to manhood, and was generally sent by his
mother to look after the cattle on the mountain. One day, in his
peregrinations along the margin of the lake, to his great astonishment,
he beheld, sitting on the unruffled surface of the water, a lady; one
of the most beautiful creatures that mortal eyes ever beheld, her hair
flowed gracefully in ringlets over her shoulders, the tresses of which
she arranged with a comb, whilst the glassy surface of her watery couch
served for the purpose of a mirror, reflecting back her own image.
Suddenly she beheld the young man standing on the brink of the lake,
with his eyes riveted on her, and unconsciously offering to herself the
provision of barley bread and cheese with which he had been provided
when he left his home.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bewildered by a feeling of love and admiration for the object
before him, he continued to hold out his hand towards the lady, who
imperceptibly glided near to him, but gently refused the offer of his
provisions. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb4" href="#v1pb4" name=
"v1pb4">4</a>]</span>He attempted to touch her, but she eluded his
grasp, saying&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">

<p class="line"><i>Nid haw&#273; fy nala.</i></p>

<p class="line">Hard baked is thy bread!</p>
<p class="line">&rsquo;Tis not easy to catch me<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2274src" href="#xd26e2274" name="xd26e2274src">3</a>;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">and immediately dived under the water and disappeared,
leaving the love-stricken youth to return home, a prey to
disappointment and regret that he had been unable to make further
acquaintance with one, in comparison with whom the whole of the fair
maidens of &#7930;an&#273;eusant and My&#273;fai<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2279src" href="#xd26e2279" name="xd26e2279src">4</a> whom he had
ever seen were as nothing.</p>
<p>On his return home the young man communicated to his mother the
extraordinary vision he had beheld. She advised him to take some
unbaked dough or &ldquo;toes&rdquo; the next time in his pocket, as
there must have been some spell connected with the hard-baked bread, or
&ldquo;Bara cras,&rdquo; which prevented his catching the lady.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Next morning, before the sun had gilded with its rays the
peaks of the Fans, the young man was at the lake, not for the purpose
of looking after his mother&rsquo;s cattle, but seeking for the same
enchanting vision he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb5" href="#v1pb5"
name="v1pb5">5</a>]</span>had witnessed the day before; but all in vain
did he anxiously strain his eyeballs and glance over the surface of the
lake, as only the ripples occasioned by a stiff breeze met his view,
and a cloud hung heavily on the summit of the Fan, which imparted an
additional gloom to his already distracted mind.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hours passed on, the wind was hushed, and the clouds which
had enveloped the mountain had vanished into thin air before the
powerful beams of the sun, when the youth was startled by seeing some
of his mother&rsquo;s cattle on the precipitous side of the acclivity,
nearly on the opposite side of the lake. His duty impelled him to
attempt to rescue them from their perilous position, for which purpose
he was hastening away, when, to his inexpressible delight, the object
of his search again appeared to him as before, and seemed much more
beautiful than when he first beheld her. His hand was again held out to
her, full of unbaked bread, which he offered with an urgent proffer of
his heart also, and vows of eternal attachment. All of which were
refused by her, saying&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>&#7930;aith dy fara!</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>Ti ni fynna&rsquo;.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Unbaked is thy bread!</p>
<p class="line">I will not have thee<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2354src" href="#xd26e2354" name="xd26e2354src">5</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">But the smiles that played upon her features as the
lady vanished beneath the waters raised within the young man a hope
that forbade him to despair by her refusal of him, and the recollection
of which cheered him on his way home. His aged parent was made
acquainted with his ill-success, and she suggested that his bread
should next time be but slightly baked, as most likely to please the
mysterious being of whom he had become enamoured.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Impelled by an irresistible feeling, the youth left
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb6" href="#v1pb6" name=
"v1pb6">6</a>]</span>his mother&rsquo;s house early next morning, and
with rapid steps he passed over the mountain. He was soon near the
margin of the lake, and with all the impatience of an ardent lover did
he wait with a feverish anxiety for the reappearance of the mysterious
lady.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The sheep and goats browsed on the precipitous sides of the
Fan; the cattle strayed amongst the rocks and large stones, some of
which were occasionally loosened from their beds and suddenly rolled
down into the lake; rain and sunshine alike came and passed away; but
all were unheeded by the youth, so wrapped up was he in looking for the
appearance of the lady.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The freshness of the early morning had disappeared before the
sultry rays of the noon-day sun, which in its turn was fast verging
towards the west as the evening was dying away and making room for the
shades of night, and hope had wellnigh abated of beholding once more
the Lady of the Lake. The young man cast a sad and last farewell look
over the waters, and, to his astonishment, beheld several cows walking
along its surface. The sight of these animals caused hope to revive
that they would be followed by another object far more pleasing; nor
was he disappointed, for the maiden reappeared, and to his enraptured
sight, even lovelier than ever. She approached the land, and he rushed
to meet her in the water. A smile encouraged him to seize her hand;
neither did she refuse the moderately baked bread he offered her; and
after some persuasion she consented to become his bride, on condition
that they should only live together until she received from him three
blows without a cause,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>Tri ergyd diachos.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Three causeless blows.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">And if he ever should happen to strike her three such
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb7" href="#v1pb7" name=
"v1pb7">7</a>]</span>blows she would leave him for ever. To such
conditions he readily consented, and would have consented to any other
stipulation, had it been proposed, as he was only intent on then
securing such a lovely creature for his wife.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thus the Lady of the Lake engaged to become the young
man&rsquo;s wife, and having loosed her hand for a moment she darted
away and dived into the lake. His chagrin and grief were such that he
determined to cast himself headlong into the deepest water, so as to
end his life in the element that had contained in its unfathomed depths
the only one for whom he cared to live on earth. As he was on the point
of committing this rash act, there emerged out of the lake <i>two</i>
most beautiful ladies, accompanied by a hoary-headed man of noble mien
and extraordinary stature, but having otherwise all the force and
strength of youth. This man addressed the almost bewildered youth in
accents calculated to soothe his troubled mind, saying that as he
proposed to marry one of his daughters, he consented to the union,
provided the young man could distinguish which of the two ladies before
him was the object of his affections. This was no easy task, as the
maidens were such perfect counterparts of each other that it seemed
quite impossible for him to choose his bride, and if perchance he fixed
upon the wrong one all would be for ever lost.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whilst the young man narrowly scanned the two ladies, he
could not perceive the least difference betwixt the two, and was almost
giving up the task in despair, when one of them thrust her foot a
slight degree forward. The motion, simple as it was, did not escape the
observation of the youth, and he discovered a trifling variation in the
mode with which their sandals were tied. This at once put an end to the
dilemma, for he, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb8" href="#v1pb8"
name="v1pb8">8</a>]</span>who had on previous occasions been so taken
up with the general appearance of the Lady of the Lake, had also
noticed the beauty of her feet and ankles, and on now recognizing the
peculiarity of her shoe-tie he boldly took hold of her hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;Thou hast chosen rightly,&rdquo; said her
father; &ldquo;be to her a kind and faithful husband, and I will give
her, as a dowry, as many sheep, cattle, goats, and horses as she can
count of each without heaving or drawing in her breath. But remember,
that if you prove unkind to her at any time, and strike her three times
without a cause, she shall return to me, and shall bring all her stock
back with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Such was the verbal marriage settlement, to which the young
man gladly assented, and his bride was desired to count the number of
sheep she was to have. She immediately adopted the mode of counting by
<i>fives</i>, thus:&mdash;One, two, three, four, five&mdash;One, two,
three, four, five; as many times as possible in rapid succession, till
her breath was exhausted. The same process of reckoning had to
determine the number of goats, cattle, and horses respectively; and in
an instant the full number of each came out of the lake when called
upon by the father.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The young couple were then married, by what ceremony was not
stated, and afterwards went to reside at a farm called Esgair
&#7930;aethdy, somewhat more than a mile from the village of
My&#273;fai, where they lived in prosperity and happiness for several
years, and became the parents of three sons, who were beautiful
children.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Once upon a time there was a christening to take place in the
neighbourhood, to which the parents were specially invited. When the
day arrived the wife appeared very reluctant to attend the christening,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb9" href="#v1pb9" name=
"v1pb9">9</a>]</span>alleging that the distance was too great for her
to walk. Her husband told her to fetch one of the horses which were
grazing in an adjoining field. &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;if you will bring me my gloves which I left in our house.&rdquo;
He went to the house and returned with the gloves, and finding that she
had not gone for the horse jocularly slapped her shoulder with one of
them, saying, &ldquo;go! go!&rdquo; (<i lang="cy">dos, dos</i>), when
she reminded him of the understanding upon which she consented to marry
him:&mdash;That he was not to strike her without a cause; and warned
him to be more cautious for the future.</p>
<p>&lsquo;On another occasion, when they were together at a wedding, in
the midst of the mirth and hilarity of the assembled guests, who had
gathered together from all the surrounding country, she burst into
tears and sobbed most piteously. Her husband touched her on her
shoulder and inquired the cause of her weeping: she said, &ldquo;Now
people are entering into trouble, and your troubles are likely to
commence, as you have the <i>second</i> time stricken me without a
cause.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Years passed on, and their children had grown up, and were
particularly clever young men. In the midst of so many worldly
blessings at home the husband almost forgot that there remained only
<i>one</i> causeless blow to be given to destroy the whole of his
prosperity. Still he was watchful lest any trivial occurrence should
take place which his wife must regard as a breach of their marriage
contract. She told him, as her affection for him was unabated, to be
careful that he would not, through some inadvertence, give the last and
only blow, which, by an unalterable destiny, over which she had no
control, would separate them for ever.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It, however, so happened that one day they were together at a
funeral, where, in the midst of the mourning and grief at the house of
the deceased, she appeared <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb10" href=
"#v1pb10" name="v1pb10">10</a>]</span>in the highest and gayest
spirits, and indulged in immoderate fits of laughter, which so shocked
her husband that he touched her, saying, &ldquo;Hush! hush! don&rsquo;t
laugh.&rdquo; She said that she laughed &ldquo;because people when they
die go out of trouble,&rdquo; and, rising up, she went out of the
house, saying, &ldquo;The last blow has been struck, our marriage
contract is broken, and at an end! Farewell!&rdquo; Then she started
off towards Esgair &#7930;aethdy, where she called her cattle and other
stock together, each by name. The cattle she called thus:&mdash;</p>

mistress. The &ldquo;little black calf,&rdquo; although it had been
slaughtered, became alive again, and walked off with the rest of the
stock at the command of the lady. This happened in the spring of the
year, and there were four oxen ploughing in one of the fields; to these
she cried:&mdash;</p>

<p class="first">Away the whole of the live stock went with the Lady
across My&#273;fai Mountain, towards the lake from whence they came, a
distance of above six miles, where they disappeared beneath its waters,
leaving no trace behind except a well-marked furrow, which was made by
the plough the oxen drew after them into the lake, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb11" href="#v1pb11" name=
"v1pb11">11</a>]</span>which remains to this day as a testimony to the
truth of this story.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What became of the affrighted ploughman&mdash;whether he was
left on the field when the oxen set off, or whether he followed them to
the lake, has not been handed down to tradition; neither has the fate
of the disconsolate and half-ruined husband been kept in remembrance.
But of the sons it is stated that they often wandered about the lake
and its vicinity, hoping that their mother might be permitted to visit
the face of the earth once more, as they had been apprised of her
mysterious origin, her first appearance to their father, and the
untoward circumstances which so unhappily deprived them of her maternal
care.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In one of their rambles, at a place near D&ocirc;l Howel, at
the Mountain Gate, still called &ldquo;&#7930;idiad y
Me&#273;ygon,&rdquo; The Physicians&rsquo; Gate, the mother appeared
suddenly, and accosted her eldest son, whose name was Rhiwa&#7931;on,
and told him that his mission on earth was to be a benefactor to
mankind by relieving them from pain and misery, through healing all
manner of their diseases; for which purpose she furnished him with a
bag full of medical prescriptions and instructions for the preservation
of health. That by strict attention thereto he and his family would
become for many generations the most skilful physicians in the country.
Then, promising to meet him when her counsel was most needed, she
vanished. But on several occasions she met her sons near the banks of
the lake, and once she even accompanied them on their return home as
far as a place still called &ldquo;Pant-y-Me&#273;ygon,&rdquo; The
dingle of the Physicians, where she pointed out to them the various
plants and herbs which grew in the dingle, and revealed to them their
medicinal qualities or virtues; and the knowledge she imparted to them,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb12" href="#v1pb12" name=
"v1pb12">12</a>]</span>together with their unrivalled skill, soon
caused them to attain such celebrity that none ever possessed before
them. And in order that their knowledge should not be lost, they wisely
committed the same to writing, for the benefit of mankind throughout
all ages.&rsquo;</p>
<p>To the legend Mr. Rees added the following notes, which we reproduce
also at full length:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And so ends the story of the Physicians of My&#273;fai, which
has been handed down from one generation to another, thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="first">As stated in the introduction of the present work
[i.e. <i>the Physicians of My&#273;vai</i>], Rhiwa&#7931;on and his
sons became Physicians to Rhys Gryg, Lord of &#7930;andovery and
Dynefor Castles, &ldquo;who gave them rank, lands, and privileges at
My&#273;fai for their maintenance in the practice of their art and
science, and the healing and benefit of those who should seek their
help,&rdquo; thus affording to those who could not afford to pay, the
best medical advice and treatment gratuitously. Such a truly royal
foundation could not fail to produce corresponding effects. So the fame
of the Physicians of My&#273;fai was soon established over the whole
country, and continued for centuries among their descendants.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The celebrated Welsh Bard, Dafy&#273; ap Gwilym, who
flourished in the following century, and was buried at the Abbey of
Tal-y-&#7931;ychau<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2573src" href=
"#xd26e2573" name="xd26e2573src">7</a>, in Carmarthenshire,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb13" href="#v1pb13" name=
"v1pb13">13</a>]</span>about the year 1368, says in one of his poems,
as quoted in Dr. Davies&rsquo; dictionary&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>Me&#273;yg ni wnai mo&#273; y gwnaeth</i></p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="line">A Physician he would not make</p>
<p class="line">As My&#273;fai made, if he had a mead fostered man.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">Of the above lands bestowed upon the Me&#273;ygon,
there are two farms in My&#273;fai parish still called
&ldquo;&#7930;wyn Ifan Fe&#273;yg,&rdquo; the Grove of Evan the
Physician; and &ldquo;&#7930;wyn Meredy&#273; Fe&#273;yg,&rdquo; the
Grove of Meredith the Physician. Esgair &#7930;aethdy, mentioned in the
foregoing legend, was formerly in the possession of the above
descendants, and so was Ty newy&#273;, near My&#273;fai, which was
purchased by Mr. Holford, of Cilgwyn, from the Rev. Charles Lloyd,
vicar of &#7930;andefa&#7931;e, Breconshire, who married a daughter of
one of the Me&#273;ygon, and had the living of &#7930;andefa&#7931;e
from a Mr. Vaughan, who presented him to the same out of gratitude,
because Mr. Lloyd&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s father had cured him of a
disease in the eye. As Mr. Lloyd succeeded to the above living in 1748,
and died in 1800, it is probable that the skilful oculist was John
Jones, who is mentioned in the following inscription on a tombstone at
present fixed against the west end of My&#273;fai Church:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first xd26e2596">HERE<br>
Lieth the body of Mr. DAVID JONES, of Mothvey, Surgeon,<br>
who was an honest, charitable, and skilful man.<br>
He died September 14th, Anno Dom&#771; 1719, aged 61.</p>
<p class="xd26e2596">JOHN JONES, Surgeon,<br>
Eldest son of the said David Jones, departed this life<br>
the 25th of November, 1739, in the 44th year<br>
of his Age, and also lyes interred hereunder.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These appear to have been the last of the Physicians who practised
at My&#273;fai. The above John Jones resided for some time at
&#7930;andovery, and was a very eminent surgeon. One of his
descendants, named <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb14" href="#v1pb14"
name="v1pb14">14</a>]</span>John Lewis, lived at Cwmbran, My&#273;fai,
at which place his great-grandson, Mr. John Jones, now resides.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dr. Morgan Owen, Bishop of &#7930;andaff, who died at
Glasa&#7931;t, parish of My&#273;fai, in 1645, was a descendant of the
Me&#273;ygon, and an inheritor of much of their landed property in that
parish, the bulk of which he bequeathed to his nephew, Morgan Owen, who
died in 1667, and was succeeded by his son Henry Owen; and at the
decease of the last of whose descendants, Robert Lewis, Esq., the
estates became, through the will of one of the family, the property of
the late D. A. S. Davies, Esq., M.P. for Carmarthenshire.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bishop Owen bequeathed to another nephew, Morgan ap Rees, son
of Rees ap John, a descendant of the Me&#273;ygon, the farm of Rhyblid,
and some other property. Morgan ap Rees&rsquo; son, Samuel Rice,
resided at Loughor, in Gower, Glamorganshire, and had a son, Morgan
Rice, who was a merchant in London, and became Lord of the Manor of
Tooting Graveney, and High Sheriff in the year 1772, and Deputy
Lieutenant of the county of Surrey, 1776. He resided at Hill House,
which he built. At his death the whole of his property passed to his
only child, John Rice, Esq., whose eldest son, the Rev. John Morgan
Rice, inherited the greater portion of his estates. The head of the
family is now the Rev. Horatio Morgan Rice, rector of South Hill with
Callington, Cornwall, and J.P. for the county, who inherited, with
other property, a small estate at Loughor. The above Morgan Rice had
landed property in &#7930;anmadock and &#7930;angenith, as well as
Loughor, in Gower, but whether he had any connexion with Howel the
Physician (ap Rhys ap &#7930;ywelyn ap Philip the Physician, and lineal
descendant from Einion ap Rhiwa&#7931;on), who resided at Cilgwryd in
Gower, is not known. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb15" href=
"#v1pb15" name="v1pb15">15</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;Amongst other families who claim descent from the Physicians
were the Bowens of Cwmydw, My&#273;fai; and Jones of Dollgarreg and
Penrhock, in the same parish; the latter of whom are represented by
Charles Bishop, of Dollgarreg, Esq., Clerk of the Peace for
Carmarthenshire, and Thomas Bishop, of Brecon, Esq.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rees Williams of My&#273;fai is recorded as one of the
Me&#273;ygon. His great-grandson was the late Rice Williams, M.D., of
Aberystwyth, who died May 16, 1842, aged 85, and appears to have been
the last, although not the least eminent, of the Physicians descended
from the mysterious Lady of &#7930;yn y Fan<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2627src" href="#xd26e2627" name="xd26e2627src">8</a>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This brings the legend of the Lady of the Fan Lake into connexion
with a widely-spread family. There is another connexion between it and
modern times, as will be seen from the following statement kindly made
to me by the Rev. A. G. Edwards, Warden of the Welsh College at
&#7930;andovery, since then appointed Bishop of St. Asaph: &lsquo;An
old woman from My&#273;fai, who is now, that is to say in January 1881,
about eighty years of age, tells me that she remembers &ldquo;thousands
and thousands of people visiting the Lake of the Little Fan on the
first Sunday or Monday in August, and when she was young she often
heard old men declare that at that time a commotion took place in the
lake, and that its waters boiled, which was taken to herald the
approach of the Lake Lady and her Oxen.&rdquo;&#8202;&rsquo; The custom
of going up to the lake on the first Sunday in August was a very well
known one in years gone by, as I have learned from a good many people,
and it is corroborated by Mr. Joseph Joseph of Brecon, who kindly
writes as follows, in reply to some queries <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb16" href="#v1pb16" name="v1pb16">16</a>]</span>of
mine: &lsquo;On the first Sunday in the month of August, &#7930;yn y
Fan Fach is supposed to be boiling (<i lang="cy">berwi</i>). I have
seen scores of people going up to see it (not boiling though) on that
day. I do not remember that any of them expected to see the Lady of the
Lake.&rsquo; As to the boiling of the lake I have nothing to say, and I
am not sure that there is anything in the following statement made as
an explanation of the yearly visit to the lake by an old fisherwoman
from &#7930;andovery: &lsquo;The best time for eels is in August, when
the north-east wind blows on the lake, and makes huge waves in it. The
eels can then be seen floating on the waves.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Last summer I went myself to the village of My&#273;fai, to see if I
could pick up any variants of the legend, but I was hardly successful;
for though several of the farmers I questioned could repeat bits of the
legend, including the Lake Lady&rsquo;s call to her cattle as she went
away, I got nothing new, except that one of them said that the youth,
when he first saw the Lake Lady at a distance, thought she was a
goose&mdash;he did not even rise to the conception of a swan&mdash;but
that by degrees he approached her, and discovered that she was a lady
in white, and that in due time they were married, and so on. My friend,
the Warden of &#7930;andovery College, seems, however, to have found a
bit of a version which may have been still more unlike the one recorded
by Mr. Rees of Tonn: it was from an old man at My&#273;fai last year,
from whom he was, nevertheless, only able to extract the statement
&lsquo;that the Lake Lady got somehow entangled in a farmer&rsquo;s
&ldquo;gambo,&rdquo; and that ever after his farm was very
fertile.&rsquo; A &lsquo;gambo,&rsquo; I ought to explain, is a kind of
a cart without sides, used in South Wales: both the name and the thing
seem to have come from England, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb17"
href="#v1pb17" name="v1pb17">17</a>]</span>though I cannot find such a
word as <i>gambo</i> or <i>gambeau</i> in the ordinary
dictionaries.</p>
<p>Among other legends about lake fairies, there are, in the third
chapter of Mr. Sikes&rsquo; <i>British Goblins</i>, two versions of
this story: the first of them differs but slightly from Mr.
Rees&rsquo;, in that the farmer used to go near the lake to see some
lambs he had bought at a fair, and that whenever he did so three
beautiful damsels appeared to him from the lake. They always eluded his
attempts to catch them: they ran away into the lake, saying, <i lang=
"cy">Cras dy fara</i>, &amp;c. But one day a piece of moist bread came
floating ashore, which he ate, and the next day he had a chat with the
Lake Maidens. He proposed marriage to one of them, to which she
consented, provided he could distinguish her from her sisters the day
after. The story then, so far as I can make out from the brief version
which Mr. Sikes gives of it, went on like that of Mr. Rees. The former
gives another version, with much more interesting variations, which
omit all reference, however, to the Physicians of My&#273;fai, and
relate how a young farmer had heard of the Lake Maiden rowing up and
down the lake in a golden boat with a golden scull. He went to the lake
on New Year&rsquo;s Eve, saw her, was fascinated by her, and left in
despair at her vanishing out of sight, although he cried out to her to
stay and be his wife. She faintly replied, and went her way, after he
had gazed at her long yellow hair and pale melancholy face. He
continued to visit the lake, and grew thin and negligent of his person,
owing to his longing. But a wise man, who lived on the mountain,
advised him to tempt her with gifts of bread and cheese, which he
undertook to do on Midsummer Eve, when he dropped into the lake a large
cheese and a loaf of bread. This he did repeatedly, until at last
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb18" href="#v1pb18" name=
"v1pb18">18</a>]</span>his hopes were fulfilled on New Year&rsquo;s
Eve. This time he had gone to the lake clad in his best suit, and at
midnight dropped seven white loaves and his biggest and finest cheese
into the lake. The Lake Lady by-and-by came in her skiff to where he
was, and gracefully stepped ashore. The scene need not be further
described: Mr. Sikes gives a picture of it, and the story then proceeds
as in the other version.</p>
<p>It is a pity that Mr. Rees did not preserve the Welsh versions out
of which he pieced together the English one; but as to Mr. Sikes, I
cannot discover whence his has been derived, for he seems not to have
been too anxious to leave anybody the means of testing his work, as one
will find on verifying his references, when he gives any. See also the
allusions to him in Hartland&rsquo;s <i>Science of Fairy Tales</i>, pp.
64, 123, 137, 165, 278.</p>
<p>Since writing the foregoing notes the following communication has
reached me from a friend of my undergraduate days at Jesus College,
Oxford, Mr. &#7930;ywarch Reynolds of Merthyr Tydfil. Only the first
part of it concerns the legend of &#7930;yn y Fan Fach; but as the rest
is equally racy I make no apology for publishing it in full without any
editing, except the insertion of the meaning of two or three of the
Welsh words occurring in it:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tell Rh&#375;s that I have just heard a sequel to the
Me&#273;ygon My&#273;fai story, got from a rustic on Myny&#273; y
Banwen, between Glynn&ecirc;&#273; and Glyntaw&euml;, on a ramble
recently with David Lewis the barrister and Sidney Hartland the
folklorist. It was to the effect that after the disappearance of the
<i lang="cy">forwn</i>, &ldquo;the damsel,&rdquo; into the lake, the
disconsolate husband and his friends set to work to drain the lake in
order to get at her, if possible. They made a great cutting into the
bank, when suddenly a huge hairy monster of hideous aspect <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb19" href="#v1pb19" name=
"v1pb19">19</a>]</span>emerged from the water and stormed at them for
disturbing him, and wound up with this threat:&mdash;</p>

all my informant knew of it. From the allusion to <i lang=

probably a tale of <i lang="cy">&#7930;yn Safa&#273;on</i>, which had
migrated to <i lang="cy">&#7930;yn y Fan</i>; because of course there
would have to be a considerable change in the &ldquo;levels&rdquo;

<p>&lsquo;We also got another tale about a <i lang="cy">cwmshurwr</i>,
&ldquo;conjurer,&rdquo; who once lived in Ystradgyrlais (as the rustic
pronounced it). The wizard was a <i lang="cy">dyn &#7931;aw-harn</i>,
&ldquo;a man with an iron hand&rdquo;; and it being reported that there
was a great treasure hidden in Myny&#273; y Drum, the wizard said he
would secure it, if he could but get some plucky fellow to spend a
night with him there. John Gethin was a plucky fellow (<i lang="cy">dyn
&ldquo;ysprydol&rdquo;</i>), and he agreed to join the <i lang="cy">dyn
&#7931;aw-harn</i> in his <i>diablerie</i>. The wizard traced two rings
on the sward touching each other &ldquo;like a number 8&rdquo;; he went
into one, and Gethin into the other, the wizard strictly charging him
on no account to step out of the ring. The <i lang=
"cy">&#7931;aw-harn</i> then proceeded to <i lang="cy">trafod &rsquo;i

soon appeared a monstrous bull, bellowing dreadfully; but the plucky
Gethin held his ground, and the bull vanished. Next came a <span class=

fire,&rdquo; which made straight for poor Gethin and made him swerve
out of the ring. Thereupon the wheel assumed the form of the <i lang=
"cy">diawl</i>, &ldquo;devil,&rdquo; who began to haul Gethin away. The
<i lang="cy">&#7931;aw-harn</i> seized hold of him and tried to get him
back. The devil was getting the upper hand, when the <i lang=
"cy">&#7931;aw-harn</i> begged the devil to let him keep Gethin while
the piece of candle he had with him lasted. The devil consented, and
let go his hold of Gethin, whereupon the <i lang="cy">cwmshurwr</i>
immediately blew out the candle, and the devil was discomfited. Gethin
preserved the piece of candle very carefully, stowing it away in a cool
place; but still it wasted away although it was never lighted. Gethin
got such a fright that he took to his bed, and as the candle wasted
away he did the same, and they both came to an end simultaneously.
Gethin vanished&mdash;and it was not his body that was put into the
coffin, but a lump of clay which was put in to save appearances! It is
said that the wizard&rsquo;s books are in an oaken chest at Waungyrlais
farm house to this day.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We got these tales on a ramble to see &ldquo;Maen y
Gwe&#273;iau,&rdquo; on the mountain near Coelbren Junction Station on
the Neath and Brecon Railway (marked on the Ordnance Map), but we had
to turn back owing to the fearful heat.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Before dismissing Mr. Reynolds&rsquo; letter I may mention a story
in point which relates to a lake on the Brecon side of the mountains.
It is given at length by the Rev. Edward Davies in his <i>Mythology and
Rites of the British Druids</i> (London, 1809), pp. 155&ndash;7.
According to this legend a door in the rock was to be found open once a
year&mdash;on May-day, as it is supposed&mdash;and from that door one
could make one&rsquo;s way to the garden of the fairies, which was an
island in the middle of the lake. This paradise of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb21" href="#v1pb21" name=
"v1pb21">21</a>]</span>exquisite bliss was invisible, however, to those
who stood outside the lake: they could only see an indistinct mass in
the centre of the water. Once on a time a visitor tried to carry away
some of the flowers given him by the fairies, but he was thereby acting
against their law, and not only was he punished with the loss of his
senses, but the door has never since been left open. It is also related
that once an adventurous person attempted to drain the water away
&lsquo;in order to discover its contents, when a terrific form arose
from the midst of the lake, commanding him to desist, or otherwise he
would drown the country.&rsquo; This form is clearly of the same
species as that which, according to Mr. Reynolds&rsquo; story,
threatened to drown the town of Brecon. Subsequent inquiries have
elicited more information, and I am more especially indebted to my
friend Mr. Ivor James, who, as registrar of the University of Wales,
has of late years been living at Brecon. He writes to the following
effect:&mdash;&lsquo;The lake you want is &#7930;yn Cwm &#7930;wch, and
the legend is very well known locally, but there are variants. Once on
a time men and boys dug a gully through the dam in order to let the
water out. A man in a red coat, sitting in an armchair, appeared on the
surface of the water and threatened them in the terms which you quote
from Mr. Reynolds. The red coat would seem to suggest that this form of
the legend dates possibly from a time since our soldiers were first
clothed in red. In another case, however, the spectre was that of an
old woman; and I am told that a somewhat similar story is told in
connexion with a well in the castle wall in the parish of
&#7930;an&#273;ew, to the north of this town&mdash;Giraldus
Cambrensis&rsquo; parish. A friend of mine is employing his spare time
at present in an inquiry into the origin of the lakes of this
<span class="corr" id="xd26e2777" title=
"Source: distriet">district</span>, and he tells me that &#7930;yn
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb22" href="#v1pb22" name=
"v1pb22">22</a>]</span>Cwm &#7930;wch is of glacial origin, its dam
being composed, as he thinks, of glacial d&eacute;bris through which
the water always percolates into the valley below. But storm water
flows over the dam, and in the course of ages has cut for itself a
gully, now about ten feet deep at the deepest point, through the
embankment. The story was possibly invented to explain that fact. There
is no cave to be seen in the rock, and probably there never was one, as
the formation is the Old Red Sandstone; and the island was perhaps
equally imaginary.&rsquo;</p>
<p>That is the substance of Mr. James&rsquo; letter, in which he,
moreover, refers to J. D. Rhys&rsquo; account of the lake in his Welsh
introduction to his Grammar, published in London in 1592, under the
title <i lang="la">Cambrobrytannic&aelig; Cymraec&aelig;ve Lingu&aelig;
Institutiones et Rudimenta</i>. There the grammarian, in giving some
account of himself, mentions his frequent sojourns at the hospitable
residence of a nobleman, named M. Morgan Mer&ecirc;dydh, near <i lang=
"cy">y Bugeildy ynn Nyphryn Tabh&icirc;da o bhywn Swydh Bhaesybhed</i>,
that is, &lsquo;near the Beguildy in the Valley of the Teme within the
county of Radnor.&rsquo; Then he continues to the following
effect:&mdash;&lsquo;But the latter part of this book was thought out
under the bushes and green foliage in a bit of a place of my own called
y Clun H&icirc;r, at the top of Cwm y &#7930;wch, below the spurs of
the mountain of Bannwchdeni, which some call Bann Arthur and others
Moel Arthur. Below that <i lang="cy">moel</i> and in its lap there is a
lake of pretty large size, unknown depth, and wondrous nature. For as
the stories go, no bird has ever been seen to repair to it or towards
it, or to swim on it: it is wholly avoided, and some say that no
animals or beasts of any kind are wont to drink of its waters. The
peasantry of that country, and especially the shepherds who are wont to
frequent these <i>moels</i> and <i>bans</i>, relate many other wonders
concerning it and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb23" href="#v1pb23"

<p class="first">Before dismissing the story of &#7930;yn y Fan Fach I
wish to append a similar one from the parish of Ystrad Dyfodwg in
Glamorganshire. The following is a translation of a version given in
Welsh in <i lang="cy">Cyfai&#7931; yr Aelwyd a&rsquo;r Frythones</i>,
edited by Elfed and Cadrawd, and published by Messrs. Williams and Son,
&#7930;ane&#7931;y. The version in question is by Cadrawd, and it is to
the following effect&mdash;see the volume for 1892, p. 59:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#7930;yn y Forwyn, &ldquo;the Damsel&rsquo;s Pool,&rdquo; is
in the parish of Ystrad Tyfodwg: the inhabitants call it also &#7930;yn
Nelferch. It lies about halfway between the farm house of Rhon&#273;a
Fechan, &ldquo;Little Rhon&#273;a,&rdquo; and the Vale of Safrwch. The
ancient tradition concerning it is somewhat as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Once on a time a farmer lived at the Rhon&#273;a Fechan: he
was unmarried, and as he was walking by the lake early one morning in
spring he beheld a young woman of beautiful appearance walking on the
other side of it. He approached her and spoke to her: she gave him to
understand that her home was in the lake, and that she owned a number
of milch cows, that lived with her at the bottom of the water. The
farmer fancied her so much that he fell in love with her over head and
ears: he asked her on the spot for her hand and heart; and he invited
her to come and spend her life with him as his wife at the Rhon&#273;a
Fechan. She declined at first, but as he was importunate she consented
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb24" href="#v1pb24" name=
"v1pb24">24</a>]</span>at last on the following conditions, namely,
that she would bring her cattle with her out of the lake, and live with
him until he and she had three disputes with one another: then, she
said, she and the cattle would return into the lake. He agreed to the
conditions, and the marriage took place. They lived very happily and
comfortably for long years; but the end was that they fell out with one
another, and, when they happened to have quarrelled for the third time,
she was heard early in the morning driving the cattle towards the lake
with these words:&mdash;</p>
<div lang="cy" class="lgouter">
<p class="line"><i>Prw dre&rsquo;, prw dre&rsquo;, prw&rsquo;r gwartheg

<p class="line"><i>Prw Milfach a Malfach, pedair

</div>
<p class="first">And into the lake they went out of sight, and there
they live to this day. And some believed that they had heard the voice
and cry of Nelferch in the whisper of the breeze on the top of the
mountain hard by&mdash;many a time after that&mdash;as an old story
(<i lang="cy">we&#273;al</i>) will have it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>From this it will be seen that the fairy wife&rsquo;s name was
supposed to have been Nelferch, and that the piece of water is called
after her. But I find that great uncertainty prevails as to the old
name of the lake, as I learn from a communication in 1894 from
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb25" href="#v1pb25" name=
"v1pb25">25</a>]</span>Mr. &#7930;ewellyn Williams, living at Porth,
only some five miles from the spot, that one of his informants assured
him that the name in use among former generations was <i lang=
"cy">&#7930;yn Alfach</i>. Mr. Williams made inquiries at the
Rhon&#273;a Fechan about the lake legend. He was told that the water
had long since been known as &#7930;yn y Forwyn, from a <i lang=
"cy">morwyn</i>, or damsel, with a number of cattle having been drowned
in it. The story of the man who mentioned the name as &#7930;yn Alfach
was similar: the maid belonged to the farm of Penrhys, he said, and the
young man to the Rhon&#273;a Fechan, and it was in consequence of their
third dispute, he added, that she left him and went back to her
previous service, and afterwards, while taking the cattle to the water,
she sank accidentally or purposely into the lake, so that she was never
found any more. Here it will be seen how modern rationalism has been
modifying the story into something quite uninteresting but without
wholly getting rid of the original features, such as the three disputes
between the husband and wife. Lastly, it is worth mentioning that this
water appears to form part of a bit of very remarkable scenery, and
that its waves strike on one side against a steep rock believed to
contain caves, supposed to have been formerly inhabited by men and
women. At present the place, I learn, is in the possession of Messrs.
Davis and Sons, owners of the Ferndale collieries, who keep a pleasure
boat on the lake. I have appealed to them on the question of the name
Nelferch or Alfach, in the hope that their books would help to decide
as to the old form of it. Replying on their behalf, Mr. J. Probert
Evans informs me that the company only got possession of the lake and
the adjacent land in 1862, and that &lsquo;<span lang="cy">&#7930;yn y
Vorwyn</span>&rsquo; is the name of the former in the oldest plan which
they have. Inquiries have also been made <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb26" href="#v1pb26" name="v1pb26">26</a>]</span>in the
neighbourhood by my friend, Mr. Reynolds, who found the old tenants of
the Rhon&#273;a Fechan Farm gone, and the neighbouring farm house of
Dyffryn Safrwch supplanted by colliers&rsquo; cottages. But he calls my
attention to the fact, that perhaps the old name was neither Nelferch
nor Alfach, as Elfarch, which would fit equally well, was once the name
of a petty chieftain of the adjoining Hundred of Sengheny&#273;, for
which he refers me to Clark&rsquo;s <i>Glamorgan Genealogies</i>, p.
511. But I have to thank him more especially for a longer version of
the fairy wife&rsquo;s call to her cattle, as given in
Glanffrwd&rsquo;s <i lang="cy">Plwyf &#7930;anwyno</i>, &lsquo;the
Parish of &#7930;anwynno&rsquo; (Pontypri&#273;, 1888), p. 117, as

<p>Mr. Probert Evans having kindly given me the address of an aged
farmer who formerly lived in the valley, my friend, Mr. &#7930;ywarch
Reynolds, was good enough to visit him. Mr. Reynolds shall report the
result in his own words, dated January 9, 1899, as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was at Pentyrch this morning, and went to see Mr. David
Evans, formerly of Cefn Colston.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The old man is a very fine specimen of the better class of
Welsh farmer; is in his eighty-third year; hale and hearty,
intelligent, and in full possession of his faculties. He was born and
bred in the Rhon&#273;a Fechan Valley, and lived there until some forty
years ago. He had often heard the lake story from an old aunt of his
who lived at the Maerdy Farm (a short distance north of the lake), and
who died a good many years ago, at a very advanced age. He calls the
lake &ldquo;&#7930;yn Elferch,&rdquo; and the story, as known to him,
has several points in common with the &#7930;yn y Fan legend, which,
however, he did not appear to know. He could not give me many details,
but the following is the substance of the story as he knows
it:&mdash;The young farmer, who lived with his mother at the
neighbouring farm, one day saw the lady on the bank of the lake,
combing her hair, which reached down to her feet. He fell in love at
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb28" href="#v1pb28" name=
"v1pb28">28</a>]</span>first sight, and tried to approach her; but she
evaded him, and crying out, <i lang="cy">&#272;ali di &#273;im o fi,
cr&acirc;s dy fara!</i> (Thou wilt not catch me, thou of the crimped
bread), she sank into the water. He saw her on several subsequent
occasions, and gave chase, but always with the same result, until at
length he got his mother to make him some bread which was not baked (or
not baked so hard); and this he offered to the lady. She then agreed to
become his wife, subject to the condition that if he offended her, or
disagreed with her three times (<i lang="cy">ar yr ammod, os byssa fa
yn &rsquo;i chroesi hi dair gwaith</i>) she would leave him and return
into the lake with all her belongings.</p>
<p>&lsquo;1. The first disagreement (<i lang="cy">croes</i>) was at the
funeral of a neighbour, a man in years, at which the lady gave way to
excessive weeping and lamentation. The husband expressed surprise and
annoyance at this excessive grief for the death of a person not related
to them, and asked the reason for it; and she replied that she grieved
for the defunct on account of the eternal misery that was in store for
him in the other world.</p>
<p>&lsquo;2. The second &ldquo;<i lang="cy">croes</i>&rdquo; was at the
death of an infant child of the lady herself, at which she laughed
immoderately; and in reply to the husband&rsquo;s remonstrance, she
said she did so for joy at her child&rsquo;s escape from this wicked
world and its passage into a world of bliss.</p>
<p>&lsquo;3. The third &ldquo;<i lang="cy">croes</i>&rdquo; Mr. Evans
was unable to call to mind, but equally with the other two it showed
that the lady was possessed of preternatural knowledge; and it resulted
in her leaving her husband and returning into the lake, taking the
cattle, &amp;c., with her. The accepted explanation of the name of the
lake was <i lang="cy">&#7930;yn El-ferch</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3062src" href="#xd26e3062" name="xd26e3062src">13</a> (= Hela
&rsquo;r ferch), &ldquo;because of the young man <i>chasing the
damsel</i>&rdquo; (<i lang="cy">hela &rsquo;r ferch</i>). <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb29" href="#v1pb29" name=
"v1pb29">29</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;The following is the cattle-call, as given to me by Mr.
Evans&rsquo; aged housekeeper, who migrated with the family from
Rhon&#273;a Fechan to Pentyrch:</p>
<div lang="cy" class="lgouter">

<p class="line"><i>Draw yn yr ithin [= eithin],</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>Dewch i gyd i lys y brenin.</i></p>
</div>
<p class="first">&lsquo;Mr. Evans told me that <i lang="cy">Dyffryn
Safrwch</i> was considered to be a corruption of <i lang="cy">Dyffryn
Safn yr Hwch</i>, &ldquo;Valley of the Sow&rsquo;s Mouth&rdquo;; so
that the explanation was not due to a minister with whom I foregathered
on my tramp near the lake the other day, and from whom I heard it
first.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The similarity between Mr. Evans&rsquo; version of this legend and
that of &#7930;yn y Fan Fach, tends to add emphasis to certain points
which I had been inclined to treat as merely accidental. In the Fan
Fach legend the young man&rsquo;s mother is a widow, and here he is
represented living with his mother. Here also something <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb30" href="#v1pb30" name=
"v1pb30">30</a>]</span>depends on the young man&rsquo;s bread, but it
is abruptly introduced, suggesting that a part of the story has been
forgotten. Both stories, however, give one the impression that the
bread of the fairies was regarded as always imperfectly baked. In both
stories the young man&rsquo;s mother comes to his help with her advice.
Mr. Evans&rsquo; version ascribes supernatural knowledge to the fairy,
though his version fails to support it; and her moralizings read
considerably later than those which the Fan legend ascribes to the
fairy wife. Some of these points may be brought under the
reader&rsquo;s notice later, when he has been familiarized with more
facts illustrative of the belief in fairies.</p>

<p class="first">On returning from South Wales to Carnarvonshire in the
summer of 1881, I tried to discover similar legends connected with the
lakes of North Wales, beginning with Geiriony&#273;, the waters of
which form a stream emptying itself into the Conwy, near Trefriw, a
little below &#7930;anrwst. I only succeeded, however, in finding an
old man of the name of Pierce Williams, about seventy years of age, who
was very anxious to talk about &lsquo;Bony&rsquo;s&rsquo; wars, but not
about lake ladies. I was obliged, in trying to make him understand what
I wanted, to use the word <i lang="cy">morforwyn</i>, that is to say in
English, &lsquo;mermaid&rsquo;; he then told me, that in his younger
days he had heard people say that somebody had seen such beings in the
Trefriw river. But as my questions were leading ones, his evidence is
not worth much; however, I feel pretty sure that one who knew the
neighbourhood of Geiriony&#273; better would be able to find some
fragments of interesting legends still existing in that wild district.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb31" href="#v1pb31" name=
"v1pb31">31</a>]</span></p>
<p>I was more successful at &#7930;anberis, though what I found, at
first, was not much; but it was genuine, and to the point. This is the
substance of it:&mdash;An old woman, called Si&acirc;n<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e3199src" href="#xd26e3199" name=
"xd26e3199src">15</a> Dafy&#273;, lived at Helfa Fawr, in the dingle
called Cwm Brwynog, along the left side of which you ascend as you go
to the top of Snowdon, from the village of lower &#7930;anberis, or
Coed y &#272;ol, as it is there called. She was a curious old person,
who made nice distinctions between the virtues of the respective waters
of the district: thus, no other would do for her to cure her of the
<i lang="cy">defaid gwy&#7931;tion</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3235src" href="#xd26e3235" name="xd26e3235src">16</a>, or
cancerous warts, which she fancied that she had in her mouth, than that
of the spring of Tai Bach, near the lake called &#7930;yn Ffynnon y
Gwas, though she seldom found it out, when she was deceived by a
servant who cherished a convenient opinion of his own, that a drop from
a nearer spring would do just as well. Old Si&acirc;n has been dead
over thirty-five years, but I have it, on the testimony of two highly
trustworthy brothers, who are of her family, and now between sixty and
seventy years of age, that she used to relate to them how a shepherd,
once on a time, saw a fairy maiden (<i lang="cy">un o&rsquo;r Tylwyth
Teg</i>) on the surface of the tarn called &#7930;yn Du&rsquo;r
Ar&#273;u, and how, from bantering and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb32" href="#v1pb32" name="v1pb32">32</a>]</span>joking, their
acquaintance ripened into courtship, when the father and mother of the
lake maiden appeared to give the union their sanction, and to arrange
the marriage settlement. This was to the effect that the husband was
never to strike his wife with iron, and that she was to bring her great
wealth with her, consisting of stock of all kinds for his mountain
farm. All duly took place, and they lived happily together until one
day, when trying to catch a pony, the husband threw a bridle to his
wife, and the iron in that struck her. It was then all over with him,
as the wife hurried away with her property into the lake, so that
nothing more was seen or heard of her. Here I may as well explain that
the &#7930;anberis side of the steep, near the top of Snowdon, is
called Clogwyn du&rsquo;r Ar&#273;u, or the Black Cliff of the
Ar&#273;u, at the bottom of which lies the tarn alluded to as the Black
Lake of the Ar&#273;u, and near it stands a huge boulder, called Maen
du&rsquo;r Ar&#273;u, all of which names are curious, as involving the
word <i lang="cy">du</i>, black. Ar&#273;u itself has much the same
meaning, and refers to the whole precipitous side of the summit with
its dark shadows, and there is a similar Ar&#273;u near Nanmor on the
Merionethshire side of Be&#273;gelert.</p>
<p>One of the brothers, I ought to have said, doubts that the lake here
mentioned was the one in old Si&acirc;n&rsquo;s tale; but he has
forgotten which it was of the many in the neighbourhood. Both, however,
remembered another short story about fairies, which they had heard
another old woman relate, namely, Mari Domos Si&ocirc;n, who died some
thirty years ago: it was merely to the effect that a shepherd had once
lost his way in the mist on the mountain on the land of Caeau Gwynion,
towards Cwe&#7931;yn<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3263src" href=
"#xd26e3263" name="xd26e3263src">17</a> Lake, and got into a ring
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb33" href="#v1pb33" name=
"v1pb33">33</a>]</span>where the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i> were
dancing: it was only after a very hard struggle that he was able, at
length, to get away from them.</p>
<p>To this I may add the testimony of a lady, for whose veracity I can
vouch, to the effect that, when she was a child in Cwm Brwynog, from
thirty to forty years ago, she and her brothers and sisters used to be
frequently warned by their mother not to go far away from the house
when there happened to be thick mist on the ground, lest they should
come across the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i> dancing, and be carried
away to their abode beneath the lake. They were always, she says,
supposed to live in the lakes; and the one here alluded to was
&#7930;yn Dwythwch, which is one of those famous for its <i lang=
"cy">torgochiaid</i> or chars. The mother is still living; but she
seems to have long since, like others, lost her belief in the
fairies.</p>
<p>After writing the above, I heard that a brother to the foregoing
brothers, namely, Mr. Thomas Davies, of Mur Mawr, &#7930;anberis,
remembered a similar tale. Mr. Davies is now sixty-four, and the
persons from whom he heard the tale were the same Si&acirc;n Dafy&#273;
of Helfa Fawr, and Mari Domos Si&ocirc;n of Tyn<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3287src" href="#xd26e3287" name="xd26e3287src">18</a> Gadlas,
&#7930;anberis: the two women were about seventy years of age when he
as a child heard it from them. At my request, a friend of mine, Mr.
Hugh D. Jones, of Tyn Gadlas, also a member of this family, which is
one of the oldest perhaps in the place, has taken down from Mr.
Davies&rsquo; mouth all he could remember, word for word, as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;To the farm of Bron y Fedw there belonged a son, who grew up
to be a young man, the women knew not how long before their time. He
was in the habit of going up the mountain to Cwm Dryweny&#273;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e3339src" href="#xd26e3339" name=
"xd26e3339src">19</a> and Myny&#273; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb35" href="#v1pb35" name="v1pb35">35</a>]</span>y Fedw, on the west
side of Snowdon, to do the shepherding, and there he was wont to come
across a lass on the mountain, so that as the result of frequently
meeting one another, he and she became great friends. They usually met
at a particular spot in Cwm Dryweny&#273;, where the girl and her
family lived, and where there were all kinds of nice things to eat, of
amusements, and of incomparable music; but he did not make up to
anybody there except the girl. The friendship ended in courtship; but
when the boy mentioned that she should be married to him, she would
only do so on one condition, namely, that she would live with him until
he should strike her with iron. They were wedded, and they lived
together for a number of years, and had children. Once on a time it
happened to be market day at Carnarvon, whither the husband and wife
thought of riding on ponies, like all the farmers of that time. So they
went to the mountain to catch a pony each. At the bottom of Myny&#273;
y Fedw there is a pool some sixty or one hundred yards long by twenty
or thirty broad, and on one side of it there is a level space along
which the horses used to run. The husband caught a pony, and gave it to
the wife to hold fast without a bridle, while he should catch another.
When he had bridled his own pony, he threw another bridle to his wife
for her to secure hers; but as he threw it, the bit of the bridle
struck her on one of her hands. The wife let go the pony, and went
headlong into the pool, and that was the end of their wedded
life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The following is a later tale, which Mr. Thomas Davies heard from
his mother, who died in 1832: she would be ninety years of age had she
been still living:&mdash;</p>
<p lang="cy"><i>Pan oe&#273; hi&rsquo;n hogan yn yr Hafod,
&#7930;anberis, yr oe&#273; hogan at ei hoed hi&rsquo;n cael ei magu yn
Cwmglas, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb36" href="#v1pb36" name=

o&rsquo;r fuches a thywel glan, ac yn ei ro&#273;i ar garreg; ac yn
mynd yno drachefn, ac yn cael y &#7931;estr yn wag, gyda darn
deusw&#7931;t neu hanner coron ac weithiau fwy wrth ei ochr.</i></p>
<p>&lsquo;When she was a girl, living at Yr Hafod, &#7930;anberis,
there was a girl of her age being brought up at Cwmglas in the same
parish. The latter was in the habit of saying, when she was a girl and
so long as she lived, that she used to have money from the <i lang=
"cy">Tylwyth Teg</i>, in the Cwmglas Hollow. Her account was, that on
dark, misty mornings she used to go to a particular spot in that Hollow
with a jugful of sweet milk from the milking place, and a clean towel,
and then place them on a stone. She would return, and find the jug
empty, with a piece of money placed by its side: that is, two shillings
or half a crown, or at times even more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A daughter of that woman lives now at a farm, Mr. Davies observes,
called Plas Pennant, in the parish of &#7930;anfihangel yn Mhennant, in
Carnarvonshire; and he adds, that it was a tale of a kind that was
common enough when he was a boy; but many laughed at it, though the old
people believed it to be a fact. To this I may as well append another
tale, which was brought to the memory of an old man who happened to be
present when Mr. Jones and Mr. Davies were busy with the foregoing. His
name is John Roberts, and his age is seventy-five: his present home is
at Capel S&iuml;on, in the neighbouring parish of
&#7930;an&#273;einiolen:&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;When a lad, he was a servant at Towyn Trewern, near Holyhead,
to an old man about his own age at present. They were one day in an old
building on the farm, and the old man told him that he had had much
money in that place when he was a lad, and that he would have had more
had it not been for his father. He had hidden the money at home, where
his mother found it and told his father of the affair: she feared he
was a bad boy, and that it was by theft he got it. His father said that
he would make him say where he got it, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb38" href="#v1pb38" name="v1pb38">38</a>]</span>or else that he
would strip him of the skin of his back, at the same time that he went
out and cut a rod fit for effecting a purpose of the kind. The boy
heard all this talk between his father and his mother, and felt
determined to keep the matter a secret, as he had been warned by the
<i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i>. He went into the house, and his father
began to question him, while he refused to answer. He supplicatingly
protested that the money was honestly got, and that he should get more
if he kept it a secret, but that, if he did not, there would be no more
to be got. However, the father would give no ear to his excuses or his
reasons, and the rod prevailed; so that the boy said that it was from
the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i> he used to get it, and that on
condition of his not telling anybody. Greatly did the old folks regret
having killed the goose that laid the eggs. The boy went many a time
afterwards to the old building, but he never found any more money
there.&rsquo;</p>

whose name is Margaret Williams. She has been living at Bettws Garmon
for many years, and is now over eighty. He does not know whether the
story is in print or not, but he is certain that Margaret Williams
never saw it, even if it be. He further thinks he has heard it from

<p>&lsquo;The story goes, that the son of a farmer, who lived at the
Ystrad in Bettws Garmon, when returning home from a journey, late in
the evening, beheld a company of fairies in the middle of their mirth
and jollity. The youth was at once bewildered by the incomparable
beauty of one of these ladies, so that he ventured to leap into the
circle and take his idol away with him. After she had tarried awhile
with him at his home, he prevailed on her, on special conditions, to
become his wife. One of these conditions was that he should not touch
her with iron of any description. She became <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb40" href="#v1pb40" name=
"v1pb40">40</a>]</span>his wife, and two children were born to them.
One day the husband was in the field trying to catch the horse; seeing
him unsuccessful, the wife went to him to help him, and, when the horse
was galloping past him, he let go the bridle at him in order to prevent
him from passing; but whom should he strike but his wife, who vanished
out of his sight on the spot.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Just as I was engaged in collecting these stories in 1881, a
correspondent sent me a copy of the Ystrad tale as published by the
late bard and antiquary, the Rev. Owen Wyn Jones, better known in Wales
by his bardic name of Glasynys<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3454src"
href="#xd26e3454" name="xd26e3454src">22</a>, in the <i lang=
"cy">Brython</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e3462src" href="#xd26e3462"
name="xd26e3462src">23</a> for 1863, p. 193. I will not attempt to
translate Glasynys&rsquo; poetic prose with all its compound
adjectives, but it comes to this in a few words. One fine sunny
morning, as the young heir of Ystrad was busied with his sheep on the
side of Moel Eilio, he met a very pretty girl, and when he got home he
told the folks there of it. A few days afterwards he met her again, and
this happened several times, when he mentioned it to his father, who
advised <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb41" href="#v1pb41" name=
"v1pb41">41</a>]</span>him to seize her when he next met her. The next
time he met her he proceeded to do so, but before he could take her
away, a little fat old man came to them and begged him to give her back
to him, to which the youth would not listen. The little man uttered
terrible threats, but the heir of Ystrad would not yield, so an
agreement was made between them, that the latter was to have the girl
to wife until he touched her skin with iron, and great was the joy both
of the son and his parents in consequence. They lived together for many
years; but once on a time, on the evening of the Bettws Fair, the
wife&rsquo;s horse became restive, and somehow, as the husband was
attending to the horse, the stirrup touched the skin of her bare leg,
and that very night she was taken away from him. She had three or four
children, and more than one of their descendants, as Glasynys
maintains, were known to him at the time he wrote in 1863. Glasynys
regards this as the same tale which is given by Williams of
&#7930;andegai, to whom we shall refer later; and he says that he heard
it scores of times when he was a lad.</p>
<p>Lastly, I happened to mention these legends last summer among others
to the Rev. Owen Davies, curate of &#7930;anberis, a man who is well
versed in Welsh literature, and thoroughly in sympathy with everything
Welsh. Mr. Davies told me that he knew a tale of the sort from his
youth, as current in the parishes of &#7930;an&#7931;echid and
&#7930;andegai, near Bangor. Not long afterwards he visited his mother
at his native place, in &#7930;an&#7931;echid, in order to have his
memory of it refreshed; and he also went to the Waen Fawr, on the other
side of Carnarvon, where he had the same legend told him with the
different localities specified. The following is the Waen Fawr version,
of which I give the Welsh as I have had it from Mr. Davies, and as it
was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb42" href="#v1pb42" name=

<p>For the sake of an occasional reader who does not know Welsh, I add
a summary of it in English.</p>
<p>One fine evening in the month of June a brave, adventurous youth,
the heir of Ystrad, went to the banks of the Gwyrfai, not far from
where it leaves Cwe&#7931;yn Lake, and hid himself in the bushes near
the spot where the folks of the Red Coats&mdash;the fairies&mdash;were
wont to dance. The moon shone forth brightly without a cloud to
intercept her light; all was quiet save where the Gwyrfai gently
murmured on her bed, and it was not long before the young man had the
satisfaction of seeing the fair family dancing in full swing. As he
gazed on the subtle course of the dance, his eyes rested on a damsel,
the most shapely and beautiful he had seen from his boyhood. Her agile
movements and the charm of her looks inflamed him with love for her, to
such a degree that he felt ready for any encounter in order to secure
her to be his own. From his hiding place he watched every move for his
opportunity; at last, with feelings of anxiety and dread, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb45" href="#v1pb45" name="v1pb45">45</a>]</span>he
leaped suddenly into the middle of the circle of the fairies. There,
while their enjoyment of the dance was at its height, he seized her in
his arms and carried her away to his home at Ystrad. But, as she
screamed for help to free her from the grasp of him who had fallen in
love with her, the dancing party disappeared like one&rsquo;s breath in
July. He treated her with the utmost kindness, and was ever anxious to
keep her within his sight and in his possession. By dint of tenderness
he succeeded so far as to get her to consent to be his servant at
Ystrad. And such a servant she turned out to be! Why, she was wont to
milk the cows thrice a day, and to have the usual quantity of milk each
time, so that the butter was so plentiful that nobody thought of
weighing it. As to her name, in spite of all his endeavours to
ascertain it, she would never tell it him. Accidentally, however, one
moonlight night, when driving two of his cows to the spot where they
should graze, he came to the place where the fairies were wont to enjoy
their games in the light of the moon. This time also he hid himself in
a thicket, when he overheard one fairy saying to another, &lsquo;When
we were last here our sister Penelope was stolen from us by a
man.&rsquo; As soon as he heard this off he went home, full of joy
because he had discovered the name of the maid that was so dear to him.
She, on the other hand, was greatly astonished to hear him call her by
her own name. As she was so charmingly pretty, so industrious, so
skilled in every work, and so attended by luck in everything she put
her hand to, he offered to make her his wife instead of being his
servant. At first she would in no wise consent, but she rather gave way
to grief at his having found her name out. However, his importunity at
length brought her to consent, but on the condition that he should not
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb46" href="#v1pb46" name=
"v1pb46">46</a>]</span>strike her with iron; if that should happen, she
would quit him never to return. The agreement was made on his side with
the readiness of love, and after this they lived in happiness and
comfort together for many years, and there were born to them a son and
a daughter, who were the handsomest children in the whole country.
Owing, also, to the skill and good qualities of the woman, as a shrewd
and virtuous wife, they became very rich&mdash;richer, indeed, than
anybody else in the country around; for, besides the husband&rsquo;s
own inheritance of Ystrad, he held all the northern part of Nant y
Bettws, and all from there to the top of Snowdon, together with Cwm
Brwynog in the parish of &#7930;anberis. But one day, as bad luck would
have it, they went out together to catch a horse in the field, and, as
the animal was somewhat wild and untamed, they had no easy work before
them. In his rashness the man threw a bridle at him as he was rushing
past him, but alas! on whom should the bridle fall but on the wife! No
sooner had this happened than she disappeared, and nothing more was
ever seen of her. But one cold night, when there was a chilling wind
blowing from the north, she came near the window of his bedroom, and
told him in these words to take care of the children:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Lest my son should find it cold,</p>
<p class="line">Place on him his father&rsquo;s coat:</p>
<p class="line">Lest the fair one find it cold,</p>
<p class="line">Place on her my petticoat.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Then she withdrew, and nothing more was heard of
her.</p>
<p>In reply to some queries of mine, Mr. O. Davies tells me that
Penelope was pronounced in three syllables,
P&eacute;n&#277;l&ocirc;p&mdash;so he heard it from his grandfather: he
goes on to say that the offspring of the Lake Lady is supposed to be
represented by a family called <i>Pellings</i>, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb47" href="#v1pb47" name=
"v1pb47">47</a>]</span>which was once a highly respected name in those
parts, and that there was a Lady Bulkeley who was of this descent, not
to mention that several people of a lower rank, both in Anglesey and
Arfon, claimed to be of the same origin. I am not very clear as to how
the name got into this tale, nor have I been able to learn anything
about the Pellings; but, as the word appears to have been regarded as a
corrupt derivative from Penelope, that is, perhaps, all the connexion,
so that it may be that it has really nothing whatever to do with the
legend. This is a point, however, which the antiquaries of North Wales
ought to be able to clear up satisfactorily.</p>
<p>In reply to queries of mine, Mr. O. Davies gave me the following
particulars:&mdash;&lsquo;I am now (June, 1881) over fifty-two years of
age, and I can assure you that I have heard the legend forty years ago.
I do not remember my father, as he died when I was young, but my
grandfather was remarkable for his delight in tales and legends, and it
was his favourite pastime during the winter nights, after getting his
short black pipe ready, to relate stories about struggles with robbers,
about bogies, and above all about the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i>; for
they were his chief delight. He has been dead twenty-six years, and he
had almost reached eighty years of age. His father before him, who was
born about the year 1740, was also famous for his stories, and my
grandfather often mentioned him as his authority in the course of his
narration of the tales. Both he and the rest of the family used to look
at Corwrion, to be mentioned presently, as a sacred spot. When I was a
lad and happened to be reluctant to leave off playing at dusk, my
mother or grandfather had only to say that &lsquo;the Pellings were
coming,&rsquo; in order to induce me to come into the house at once:
indeed, this announcement had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb48"
href="#v1pb48" name="v1pb48">48</a>]</span>the same effect on persons
of a much riper age than mine then was.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Further, Mr. Davies kindly called my attention to a volume, entitled
<i>Observations on the Snowdon Mountains</i>, by Mr. William Williams,
of &#7930;andegai, published in London in 1802. In that work this tale
is given somewhat less fully than by Mr. Davies&rsquo; informant, but
the author makes the following remarks with regard to it, pp. 37,
40:&mdash;&lsquo;A race of people inhabiting the districts about the
foot of Snowdon, were formerly distinguished and known by the nickname
of <i>Pellings</i>, which is not yet extinct. There are several persons
and even families who are reputed to be descended from these
people&#8202;&hellip;. These children [Penelope&rsquo;s] and their
descendants, they say, were called <i>Pellings</i>, a word corrupted
from their mother&rsquo;s name, Penelope. The late Thomas Rowlands,
Esq., of Caerau, in Anglesey, the father of the late Lady Bulkeley, was
a descendant of this lady, if it be true that the name <i>Pellings</i>
came from her; and there are still living several opulent and
respectable people who are known to have sprung from the
<i>Pellings</i>. The best blood in my own veins is this
fairy&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lastly, it will be noticed that these last versions do not
distinctly suggest that the Lake Lady ran into the lake, that is into
Cwe&#7931;yn, but rather that she disappeared in the same way as the
dancing party by simply becoming invisible like one&rsquo;s breath in
July. The fairies are called in Welsh, <i lang="cy">Y Tylwyth Teg</i>,
or the Fair Family; but the people of Arfon have been so familiarized
with the particular one I have called the Lake Lady, that, according to
one of my informants, they have invented the term <i lang="cy">Y
Dylwythes Deg</i>, or even <i lang="cy">Y Dylwythen Deg</i>, to denote
her; but it is unknown to the others, so that the extent of its use is
not very considerable. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb49" href=
"#v1pb49" name="v1pb49">49</a>]</span></p>
<p>This is, perhaps, the place to give another tale, according to which
the man goes to the Lake Maiden&rsquo;s country, instead of her
settling with him at his home. I owe it to the kindness of Mr. William
Jones, of Regent Place, &#7930;ango&#7931;en, a native of
Be&#273;gelert. He heard it from an old man before he left
Be&#273;gelert, but when he sent a friend to inquire some time
afterwards, the old man was gone. According to Mr. Jones, the details
of the tale are, for that reason, imperfect, as some of the incidents
have faded from his memory; but such as he can still remember the tale,
it is here given in his own words:&mdash;</p>
<p lang="cy"><i>Ryw noson lawn &#7931;oer ac un o feibion &#7930;wyn On

<p>&lsquo;One bright moonlight night, as one of the sons of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb50" href="#v1pb50" name=
"v1pb50">50</a>]</span>farmer who lived at &#7930;wyn On in Nant y
Bettws was going to pay his addresses to a girl at Clogwyn y Gwin, he
beheld the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i> enjoying themselves in full
swing on a meadow close to Cwe&#7931;yn Lake. He approached them, and
little by little he was led on by the enchanting sweetness of their
music and the liveliness of their playing until he had got within their
circle. Soon some kind of spell passed over him, so that he lost his
knowledge of the place, and found himself in a country, the most
beautiful he had ever seen, where everybody spent his time in mirth and
rejoicing. He had been there seven years, and yet it seemed to him but
a night&rsquo;s dream; but a faint recollection came to his mind of the
business on which he had left home, and he felt a longing to see his
beloved one. So he went and asked for permission to return home, which
was granted him, together with a host of attendants to lead him to his
country; and, suddenly, he found himself, as if waking from a dream, on
the bank where he had seen the fair family amusing themselves. He
turned towards home, but there he found everything changed: his parents
were dead, his brothers could not recognize him, and his sweetheart was
married to another man. In consequence of such changes he died
broken-hearted in less than a week after coming back.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="first">The Rev. O. Davies regarded the &#7930;an&#7931;echid
legend as so very like the one he got about Cwe&#7931;yn Lake and the
Waen Fawr, that he has not written the former out at length, but merely
pointed out the following differences: (1) Instead of Cwe&#7931;yn, the
lake in the former is the pool of Corwrion, in the parish of
&#7930;andegai, near Bangor. (2) What the Lake Lady was struck with was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb51" href="#v1pb51" name=
"v1pb51">51</a>]</span>not a bridle, but an iron fetter: the word used
is <i lang="cy">&#7931;yfether</i>, which probably means a long fetter
connecting a fore-foot and a hind-foot of a horse together. In Arfon,
the word is applied also to a cord tying the two fore-feet together,
but in Cardiganshire this would be called a <i lang="cy">hual</i>, the
other word, there pronounced <i lang="cy">llowethir</i>, being confined
to the long fetter. In books, the word is written <i lang=
"cy">llywethair</i>, <i lang="cy">llefethair</i> and <i lang=
"cy">llyffethair</i> or <i lang="cy">llyffethar</i>, which is possibly
the pronunciation in parts of North Wales, especially Arfon. This is an
interesting word, as it is no other than the English term &lsquo;long
fetter,&rsquo; borrowed into Welsh; as, in fact, it was also into Irish
early enough to call for an article on it in Cormac&rsquo;s <i>Irish
Glossary</i>, where <i lang="ga">langfiter</i> is described as an
English word for a fetter between the fore and the hind legs: in
Anglo-Manx it is become <i lang="gv">lanketer</i>. (3) The field in
which they were trying to catch the horse is, in the
&#7930;an&#7931;echid version, specified as that called Maes Madog, at
the foot of the &#7930;efn. (4) When the fairy wife ran away, it was
headlong into the pool of Corwrion, calling after her all her milch
cows, and they followed her with the utmost readiness.</p>
<p>Before going on to mention bits of information I have received from
others about the &#7930;an&#7931;echid legend, I think it best here to
finish with the items given me by Mr. O. Davies, whom I cannot too
cordially thank for his readiness to answer my questions. Among other
things, he expresses himself to the following effect:&mdash; &lsquo;It
is to this day a tradition&mdash;and I have heard it a hundred
times&mdash;that the dairy of Corwrion excelled all other dairies in
those parts, that the milk was better and more plentiful, and that the
cheese and butter were better there than in all the country round, the
reason assigned being that the cattle on the farm of Corwrion had mixed
with the breed belonging to the fairy, who <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb52" href="#v1pb52" name=
"v1pb52">52</a>]</span>had run away after being struck with the iron
fetter. However that may be, I remember perfectly well the high terms
of praise in which the cows of Corwrion used to be spoken of as being
remarkable for their milk and the profit they yielded; and, when I was
a boy, I used to hear people talk of <i lang="cy">Tarw Penwyn
Corwrion</i>, or &ldquo;the White-headed Bull of Corwrion,&rdquo; as
derived from the breed of cattle which had formed the fairy
maiden&rsquo;s dowry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>My next informant is Mr. Hugh Derfel Hughes, of Pendinas,
&#7930;andegai<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3641src" href="#xd26e3641"
name="xd26e3641src">24</a>, who has been kind enough to give me the
version, of which I here give the substance in English, premising that
Mr. Hughes says that he has lived about thirty-four years within a mile
of the pool and farm house called Corwrion, and that he has refreshed
his memory of the legend by questioning separately no less than three
old people, who had been bred and born at or near that spot. He is a
native of Merioneth, but has lived at &#7930;andegai for the last
thirty-seven years, his age now being sixty-six. I may add that Mr.
Hughes is a local antiquary of great industry and zeal; and that he
published a book on the antiquities of the district, under the title of
<i lang="cy">Hynafiaethau &#7930;andegai a &#7930;an&#7931;echid</i>,
that is &lsquo;the Antiquities of &#7930;andegai and
&#7930;an&#7931;echid&rsquo; (Bethesda, 1866); but it is out of print,
and I have had some trouble to procure a copy:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In old times, when the fairies showed themselves much oftener
to men than they do now, they made their home in the bottomless pool of
Corwrion, in Upper Ar&#7931;echwe&#273;, in that wild portion of
Gwyne&#273; called <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb53" href="#v1pb53"
name="v1pb53">53</a>]</span>Arfon. On fine mornings in the month of
June these diminutive and nimble folk might be seen in a regular line
vigorously engaged in mowing hay, with their cattle in herds busily
grazing in the fields near Corwrion. This was a sight which often met
the eyes of the people on the sides of the hills around, even on
Sundays; but when they hurried down to them they found the fields
empty, with the sham workmen and their cows gone, all gone. At other
times they might be heard hammering away like miners, shovelling
rubbish aside, or emptying their carts of stones. At times they took to
singing all the night long, greatly to the delight of the people about,
who dearly loved to hear them; and, besides singing so charmingly, they
sometimes formed into companies for dancing, and their movements were
marvellously graceful and attractive. But it was not safe to go too
near the lake late at night, for once a brave girl, who was troubled
with toothache, got up at midnight and went to the brink of the water
in search of the root of a plant that grows there full of the power to
kill all pain in the teeth. But, as she was plucking up a bit of it,
there burst on her ear, from the depths of the lake, such a shriek as
drove her back into the house breathless with fear and trembling; but
whether this was not the doing of a stray fairy, who had been
frightened out of her wits at being suddenly overtaken by a damsel in
her nightdress, or the ordinary fairy way of curing the toothache,
tradition does not tell. For sometimes, at any rate, the fairies busied
themselves in doing good to the men and women who were their
neighbours, as when they tried to teach them to keep all promises and
covenants to which they pledged themselves. A certain man and his wife,
to whom they wished to teach this good habit, have never been
forgotten. The husband had been behaving as <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb54" href="#v1pb54" name="v1pb54">54</a>]</span>he
ought, until one day, as he held the plough, with the wife guiding his
team, he broke his covenant towards her by treating her harshly and
unkindly. No sooner had he done so, than he was snatched through the
air and plunged in the lake. When the wife went to the brink of the
water to ask for him back, the reply she had was, that he was there,
and that there he should be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The fairies when engaged in dancing allowed themselves to be
gazed at, a sight which was wont greatly to attract the young men of
the neighbourhood, and once on a time the son and heir of the owner of
Corwrion fell deeply in love with one of the graceful maidens who
danced in the fairy ring, for she was wondrously beautiful and pretty
beyond compare. His passion for her ere long resulted in courtship, and
soon in their being married, which took place on the express
understanding, that firstly the husband was not to know her name,
though he might give her any name he chose; and, secondly, that he
might now and then beat her with a rod, if she chanced to misbehave
towards him; but he was not to strike her with iron on pain of her
leaving him at once. This covenant was kept for some years, so that
they lived happily together and had four children, of whom the two
youngest were a boy and a girl. But one day as they went to one of the
fields of Bryn Twrw in the direction of Pennar&#273; Gron, to catch a
pony, the fairy wife, being so much nimbler than her husband, ran
before him and had her hand in the pony&rsquo;s mane in no time. She
called out to her husband to throw her a halter, but instead of that he
threw towards her a bridle with an iron bit, which, as bad luck would
have it, struck her. The wife at once flew through the air, and plunged
headlong into Corwrion Pool. The husband returned <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb55" href="#v1pb55" name=
"v1pb55">55</a>]</span>sighing and weeping towards Bryn Twrw,
&ldquo;Noise Hill,&rdquo; and when he had reached it, the <i lang=
"cy">twrw</i>, &ldquo;noise,&rdquo; there was greater than had ever
been heard before, namely that of weeping after
&ldquo;Belen&euml;&rdquo;; and it was then, after he had struck her
with iron, that he first learnt what his wife&rsquo;s name was.
Belen&euml; never came back to her husband, but the feelings of a
mother once brought her to the window of his bedroom, where she gave
him the following order:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>Os by&#273; anwyd ar fy mab,</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>Rho&rsquo;wch am dano gob ei dad;</i></p>

<div class="lg">

<p class="line">Let him wear his father&rsquo;s coat;</p>
<p class="line">If the fair one feel the cold,</p>
<p class="line">Let her wear my petticoat.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">&lsquo;As years and years rolled on a grandson of
Belen&euml;&rsquo;s fell in love with a beautiful damsel who lived at a
neighbouring farm house called Tai Teulwriaid, and against the will of
his father and mother they married, but they had nothing to stock their
land with. So one morning what was their astonishment, when they got
up, to see grazing quietly in the field six black cows and a
white-headed bull, which had come up out of the lake as stock for them
from old grannie Belen&euml;? They served them well with milk and
butter for many a long year, but on the day the last of the family
died, the six black cows and the white-headed bull disappeared into the
lake, never more to be seen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hughes referred to no less than three other versions, as
follows:&mdash;(1) According to one account, the husband was ploughing,
with the wife leading the team, when by chance he came across her and
the accident happened. The wife then flew away like a wood-hen
(<i lang="cy">iar goed</i>) into the lake. (2) Another says that they
were in a stable trying to bridle one of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb56" href="#v1pb56" name=
"v1pb56">56</a>]</span>horses, when the misfortune took place through
inadvertence. (3) A third specifies the field in front of the house at
Corwrion as the place where the final accident took place, when they
were busied with the cows and horses.</p>
<p>To these I would add the following traditions, which Mr. Hughes
further gives. Sometimes the inhabitants, who seem to have been on the
whole on good terms with the fairies, used to heat water and leave it
in a vessel on the hearth overnight for the fairies to wash their
children in it. This they considered such a kindness that they always
left behind them on the hearth a handful of their money. Some pieces
are said to have been sometimes found in the fields near Corwrion, and
that they consisted of coins which were smaller than our halfpennies,
but bigger than farthings, and had a harp on one side. But the
tradition is not very definite on these points.</p>
<p>Here also I may as well refer to a similar tale which I got last
year at &#7930;anberis from a man who is a native of the
&#7930;an&#7931;echid side of the mountain, though he now lives at
&#7930;anberis. He is about fifty-five years of age, and remembers
hearing in his youth a tale connected with a house called
Hafoty&rsquo;r Famaeth, in a very lonely situation on
&#7930;an&#7931;echid Mountain, and now represented only by some old
ruined walls. It was to the effect that one night, when the man who
lived there was away from home, his wife, who had a youngish baby,
washed him on the hearth, left the water there, and went to bed with
her little one: she woke up in the night to find that the <i lang=
"cy">Tylwyth Teg</i> were in possession of the hearth, and busily
engaged in washing their children. That is all I got of this tale of a
well-known type.</p>
<p>To return to Mr. Hughes&rsquo; communications, I would select from
them some remarks on the topography of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb57" href="#v1pb57" name="v1pb57">57</a>]</span>the teeming home of
the fairies. He estimated the lake or pool of Corwrion to be about 120
yards long, and adds that it is nearly round; but he thinks it was
formerly considerably larger, as a cutting was made some eighty or a
hundred years ago to lead water from it to Penrhyn Castle; but even
then its size would not approach that ascribed to it by popular belief,
according to which it was no less than three miles long. In fact it was
believed that there was once a town of Corwrion which was swallowed up
by the lake, a sort of idea which one meets with in many parts of
Wales, and some of the natives are said to be able to discern the
houses under the water. This must have been near the end which is not
bottomless, the latter being indicated by a spot which is said never to
freeze even in hard winters. Old men remember it the resort of herons,
cormorants, and the water-hen (<i lang="cy">hobi wen</i>). Near the
banks there grew, besides the water-lily, various kinds of rushes and
sedges, which were formerly much used for making mats and other useful
articles. It was also once famous for eels of a large size, but it is
not supposed to have contained fish until Lord Penrhyn placed some
there in recent years. It teemed, however, with leeches of three
different kinds so recently that an old man still living describes to
Mr. Hughes his simple way of catching them when he was a boy, namely,
by walking bare-legged in the water: in a few minutes he landed with
nine or ten leeches sticking to his legs, some of which fetched a
shilling each from the medical men of those days. Corwrion is now a
farm house occupied by Mr. William Griffiths, a grandson of the late
bard Gutyn Peris. When Mr. Hughes called to make inquiries about the
legend, he found there the foundations of several old buildings, and
several pieces of old querns about the place. He <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb58" href="#v1pb58" name=
"v1pb58">58</a>]</span>thinks that there belonged to Corwrion in former
times, a mill and a fuller&rsquo;s house, which he seems to infer from
the names of two neighbouring houses called &lsquo;Y Felin Hen,&rsquo;
the Old Mill, and &lsquo;Pandy Tre Garth,&rsquo; the Fulling Mill of
Tregarth, respectively. He also alludes to a <i lang="cy">gefail</i> or
smithy there, in which one Rhys ab Robert used to work, not to mention
that a great quantity of ashes, such as come from a smithy, are found
at the end of the lake furthest from the farm house. The spot on which
Corwrion stands is part of the ground between the Ogwen and another
stream which bears the name of &lsquo;Afon Cegin Arthur,&rsquo; or the
River of Arthur&rsquo;s Kitchen, and most of the houses and fields
about have names which have suggested various notions to the people
there: such are the farms called &lsquo;Coed Howel,&rsquo; whence the
belief in the neighbourhood that Howel &#272;a, King of Wales, lived
here. About him Mr. Hughes has a great deal to say: among other things,
that he had boats on Corwrion lake, and that he was wont to present the
citizens of Bangor yearly with 300 fat geese reared on the waters of
the same. I am referred by another man to a lecture delivered in the
neighbourhood on these and similar things by the late bard and
antiquary the Rev. Robert Ellis (Cyn&#273;elw), but I have never come
across a copy. A field near Corwrion is called &lsquo;Cae
Stabal,&rsquo; or the Field of the Stable, which contains the remains
of a row of stables, as it is supposed, and of a number of mangers
where Howel&rsquo;s horses were once fed. In a neighbouring wood,
called &lsquo;Parc y Ge&#7931;i&rsquo; or &lsquo;Hopiar y
Ge&#7931;i,&rsquo; my informant goes on to say, there are to be seen
the foundations of seventeen or eighteen old hut-circles, and near them
some think they see the site of an old church. About a mile to the
south-east of Corwrion is Pendinas, which Mr. Hughes describes as
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb59" href="#v1pb59" name=
"v1pb59">59</a>]</span>an old triangular Welsh fortress, on the bank of
the Ogwen; and within two stone&rsquo;s-throws or so of Corwrion on the
south side of it, and a little to the west of Bryn Twrw mentioned in
the legend, is situated Penar&#273; Gron, a <i lang="cy">caer</i> or
fort, which he describes as being, before it was razed in his time,
forty-two yards long by thirty-two wide, and defended by a sort of
rampart of earth and stone several yards wide at the base. It used to
be the resort of the country people for dancing, cock-fighting<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e3745src" href="#xd26e3745" name=
"xd26e3745src">26</a>, and other amusements on Sundays. Near it was a
cairn, which, when it was dug into, was found to cover a kistvaen, a
pot, and a quern: a variety of tales attaching to it are told
concerning ghosts, caves, and hidden treasures. Altogether Mr. Hughes
is strongly of opinion that Corwrion and its immediate surroundings
represent a spot which at one time had great importance; and I see no
reason wholly to doubt the correctness of that conclusion, but it would
be interesting to know whether Penrhyn used, as Mr. Hughes suggests, to
be called Penrhyn Corwrion; there ought, perhaps, to be no great
difficulty in ascertaining this, as some of the Penrhyn estate appears
to have been the subject of litigation in times gone by.</p>
<p>Before leaving Mr. Hughes&rsquo; notes, I must here give his too
brief account of another thing connected with Corwrion, though,
perhaps, not with the legends here in question. I allude to what he
calls the Lantern Ghost (<i lang="cy">Ysbryd y
Lantar</i>):&mdash;&lsquo;There used to be formerly,&rsquo; he says,
&lsquo;and there is still at Corwrion, a good-sized sour apple-tree,
which during the winter half of the year used to be lit up by fire. It
began slowly and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb60" href="#v1pb60"
name="v1pb60">60</a>]</span>grew greater until the whole seemed to be
in a blaze. He was told by an old woman that she formerly knew old
people who declared they had seen it. In the same way the trees in
Hopiar y Ge&#7931;i appeared, according to them, to be also lit up with
fire.&rsquo; This reminds me of Mr. Fitzgerald&rsquo;s account of the
Irish Bile-Tineadh in the <i lang="fr">Revue Celtique</i>, iv. 194.</p>
<p>After communicating to me the notes of which the foregoing are
abstracts, Mr. Hughes kindly got me a version of the legend from Mr.
David Thomas, of Pont y Wern, in the same neighbourhood, but as it
contains nothing which I have not already given from Mr. Hughes&rsquo;
own, I pass it by. Mr. Thomas, however, has heard that the number of
the houses making up the town of Corwrion some six or seven centuries
ago was about seventy-five; but they were exactly seventy-three
according to my next informant, Mr. David Evan Davies, of Treflys,
Bethesda, better known by his bardic name of Dewi Glan Ffrydlas. Both
these gentlemen have also heard the tradition that there was a church
at Corwrion, where there used to be every Sunday a single service,
after which the people went to a spot not far off to amuse themselves,
and at night to watch the fairies dancing, or to mix with them while
they danced in a ring around a glow-worm. According to Dewi Glan
Ffrydlas, the spot was the Pen y Bonc, already mentioned, which means,
among other things, that they chose a rising ground. This is referred
to in a modern rhyme, which runs thus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>A&rsquo;r Tylwyth Teg yn dawnsio&rsquo;n
sionc</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>O gylch mag&iuml;en Pen y Bonc.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">With the fairies nimbly dancing round</p>
<p class="line">The glow-worm on the Rising Ground.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">Dewi Glan Ffrydlas has kindly gone to the trouble of
giving me a brief, but complete, version of the legend as he has heard
it. It will be noticed that the discovering <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb61" href="#v1pb61" name="v1pb61">61</a>]</span>of
the fairy&rsquo;s name is an idle incident in this version: it is
brought in too late, and no use is made of it when introduced. This is
the substance of his story in English:&mdash;&lsquo;At one of the
dances at Pen y Bonc, the heir of Corwrion&rsquo;s eyes fell on one of
the damsels of the fair family, and he was filled with love for her.
Courtship and marriage in <span class="corr" id="xd26e3779" title=
"Source: duetime">due time</span> ensued, but he had to agree to two
conditions, namely, that he was neither to know her name nor to strike
her with iron. By-and-by they had children, and when the husband
happened to go, during his wife&rsquo;s confinement, to a merry-making
at Pen y Bonc, the fairies talked together concerning his wife, and in
expressing their feelings of sympathy for her, they inadvertently
betrayed the mystery of her name by mentioning it within his hearing.
Years rolled on, when the husband and wife went out together one day to
catch a colt of theirs that had not been broken in, their object being
to go to Conway Fair. Now, as she was swifter of foot than her husband,
she got hold of the colt by the mane, and called out to him to throw
her a halter, but instead of throwing her the one she asked for, he
threw another with iron in it, which struck her. Off she went into the
lake. A grandson of this fairy many years afterwards married one of the
girls of Corwrion. They had a large piece of land, but no means of
stocking it, so that they felt rather distressed in their minds. But lo
and behold! one day a white-headed bull came out of the lake, bringing
with him six black cows to their land. There never were the like of
those cows for milk, and great was the prosperity of their owners, as
well as the envy it kindled in their neighbours&rsquo; breasts. But
when they both grew old and died, the bull and the cows went back into
the lake.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now I add the other sayings about the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i>,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb62" href="#v1pb62" name=
"v1pb62">62</a>]</span>which Dewi Glan Ffrydlas has kindly collected
for me, beginning with a blurred story about changelings:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Once on a time, in the fourteenth century, the wife of a man
at Corwrion had twins, and she complained one day to a witch, who lived
close by, at Ty&#273;yn y Barcud, that the children were not getting
on, but that they were always crying day and night. &ldquo;Are you sure
that they are your children?&rdquo; asked the witch, adding that it did
not seem to her that they were like hers. &ldquo;I have my doubts
also,&rdquo; said the mother. &ldquo;I wonder if somebody has exchanged
children with you,&rdquo; said the witch. &ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo;
said the mother. &ldquo;But why do you not seek to know?&rdquo; asked
the other. &ldquo;But how am I to go about it?&rdquo; said the mother.
The witch replied, &ldquo;Go and do something rather strange before
their eyes and watch what they will say to one another.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well, I do not know what I should do,&rdquo; said the mother.
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;take an egg-shell, and
proceed to brew beer in it in a chamber aside, and come here to tell me
what the children will say about it.&rdquo; She went home and did as
the witch had directed her, when the two children lifted their heads
out of the cradle to find what she was doing&mdash;to watch and to
listen. Then one observed to the other, &ldquo;I remember seeing an oak
having an acorn,&rdquo; to which the other replied, &ldquo;And I
remember seeing a hen having an egg&rdquo;; and one of the two added,
&ldquo;But I do not remember before seeing anybody brew beer in the
shell of a hen&rsquo;s egg.&rdquo; The mother then went to the witch
and told her what the twins had said one to the other; and she directed
her to go to a small wooden bridge, not far off, with one of the
strange children under each arm, and there to drop them from the bridge
into the river beneath. The mother went back home again and did as she
had been directed. When she reached home <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb63" href="#v1pb63" name="v1pb63">63</a>]</span>this time, she
found to her astonishment that her own children had been brought
back.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Next comes a story about a midwife who lived at Corwrion. &lsquo;One
of the fairies called to ask her to come and attend on his wife. Off
she went with him, and she was astonished to be taken into a splendid
palace. There she continued to go night and morning to dress the baby
for some time, until one day the husband asked her to rub her eyes with
a certain ointment he offered her. She did so, and found herself
sitting on a tuft of rushes, and not in a palace. There was no baby:
all had disappeared. Some time afterwards she happened to go to the
town, and whom should she there see busily buying various wares, but
the fairy on whose wife she had been attending. She addressed him with
the question, &ldquo;How are you to-day?&rdquo; Instead of answering
her, he asked, &ldquo;How do you see me?&rdquo; &ldquo;With my
eyes,&rdquo; was the prompt reply. &ldquo;Which eye?&rdquo; he asked.
&ldquo;This one,&rdquo; said the woman, pointing to it; and instantly
he disappeared, never more to be seen by her.&rsquo; This tale, as will
be seen on comparison later, is incomplete, and probably incorrect.</p>
<p>Here is another from Mr. D. E. Davies:&mdash;&lsquo;One day Guto,
the farmer of Corwrion, complained to his wife that he lacked men to
mow his hay, when she replied, &ldquo;Why fret about it? look yonder!
There you have a field full of them at it, and stripped to their
shirt-sleeves (<i lang="cy">yn &#7931;ewys eu crysau</i>).&rdquo; When
he went to the spot the sham workmen of the fairy family had
disappeared. This same Guto&mdash;or somebody else&mdash;happened
another time to be ploughing, when he heard some person he could not
see, calling out to him, &ldquo;I have got the <i>bins</i> (that is the
<i>vice</i>) of my plough broken.&rdquo; &ldquo;Bring it to me,&rdquo;
said the driver of Guto&rsquo;s team, &ldquo;that I may mend it.&rdquo;
When they finished the furrow, they found the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb64" href="#v1pb64" name=
"v1pb64">64</a>]</span>broken vice, with a barrel of beer placed near
it. One of the men sat down and mended the vice. Then they made another
furrow, and when they returned to the spot they found there a two-eared
dish filled to the brim with <i lang="cy">bara a chwrw</i>, or
&ldquo;bread and beer.&rdquo; The word <i>vice</i>, I may observe, is
an English term, which is applied in Carnarvonshire to a certain part
of the plough: it is otherwise called <i>bins</i>, but neither does
this seem to be a Welsh word, nor have I heard either used in South
Wales.</p>
<p>At times one of the fairies was in the habit, as I was told by more
than one of my informants, of coming out of &#7930;yn Corwrion with her
spinning-wheel (<i lang="cy">troe&#7931; bach</i>) on fine summer days
and betaking herself to spinning. While at that work she might be heard
constantly singing or humming, in a sort of round tune, the words
<i lang="cy">s&igrave;li ffrit</i>. So that <i lang="cy">s&igrave;li
ffrit Leisa B&egrave;la</i> may now be heard from the mouths of the
children in that neighbourhood. But I have not been successful in
finding out what Liza Bella&rsquo;s &lsquo;silly frit&rsquo; exactly
means, though I am, on the whole, convinced that the words are other
than of Welsh origin. The last of them, <i lang="cy">ffrit</i>, is
usually applied in Cardiganshire to anything worthless or
insignificant, and the derivative, <i lang="cy">ffrityn</i>, means one
who has no go or perseverance in him: the feminine is <i lang=
"cy">ffriten</i>. In Carnarvonshire my wife has heard <i lang=
"cy">ffrityn</i> and <i lang="cy">ffritan</i> applied to a small man
and a small woman respectively. Mr. Hughes says that in Merioneth and
parts of Powys <i lang="cy">s&igrave;li ffrit</i> is a term applied to
a small woman or a female dwarf who happens to be proud, vain, and fond
of the attentions of the other sex (<i lang="cy">benyw fach neu
goraches falch a hunanol a fy&#273;ai hoff o garu</i>); but he thinks
he has heard it made use of with regard to the gipsies, and possibly
also to the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i>. The Rev. O. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb65" href="#v1pb65" name=
"v1pb65">65</a>]</span>Davies thinks the words <i lang="cy">s&igrave;li
ffrit Leisa B&egrave;la</i> to be very modern, and that they refer to a
young woman who lived at a place in the neighbourhood, called Bryn
B&egrave;la or Brymb&egrave;la, &lsquo;Bella&rsquo;s Hill,&rsquo; the
point being that this Bella was ahead, in her time, of all the girls in
those parts in matters of taste and fashion. This however does not seem
to go far enough back, and it is possible still that in <i lang=
"cy">B&egrave;la</i>, that is, in English spelling, <i>Bella</i>, we
have merely a shortening of some such a name as Isabella or Arabella,
which were once much more popular in the Principality than they are
now: in fact, I do not feel sure that <i lang="cy">Leisa
B&egrave;la</i> is not bodily a corruption of <i>Isabella</i>. As to
<i lang="cy">s&igrave;li ffrit</i>, one might at first have been
inclined to render it by small fry, especially in the sense of the
French &lsquo;<span lang="fr">de la friture</span>&rsquo; as applied to
young men and boys, and to connect it with the Welsh <i lang=
"cy">sil</i> and <i lang="cy">silod</i>, which mean small fish; but the
pronunciation of <i lang="cy">silli</i> or <i lang="cy">s&igrave;li</i>
being nearly that of the English word <i>silly</i>, it appears, on the
whole, to belong to the host of English words to be found in colloquial
Welsh, though they seldom find their way into books. Students of
English ought to be able to tell us whether <i>frit</i> had the meaning
here suggested in any part of England, and how lately; also, whether
there was such a phrase as &lsquo;silly frit&rsquo; in use. After
penning this, I received the following interesting communication from
Mr. William Jones, of &#7930;ango&#7931;en:&mdash;The term <i lang=
"cy">s&igrave;li ffrit</i> was formerly in use at Be&#273;gelert, and
what was thereby meant was a child of the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i>.
It is still used for any creature that is smaller than ordinary.
&lsquo;Pooh, a silly frit like that!&rsquo; (<i lang="cy">Pw, rhyw
s&igrave;li ffrit fel yna!</i>). &lsquo;Mrs. So-and-So has a fine
child.&rsquo; &lsquo;Ha, do you call a silly frit like that a fine
child?&rsquo; (<i lang="cy">Mae gan hon a hon blentyn braf. Ho, a ydych
chwi&rsquo;n galw rhyw s&igrave;li ffrit fel hwnna&rsquo;n <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb66" href="#v1pb66" name=
"v1pb66">66</a>]</span>braf?</i>) To return to Leisa B&egrave;la and
Belen&euml;, it may be that the same person was meant by both these
names, but I am in no hurry to identify them, as none of my
correspondents knows the latter of them except Mr. Hughes, who gives it
on the authority of the bard Gutyn Peris, and nothing further so far as
I can understand, whereas B&egrave;la will come before us in another
story, as it is the same name, I presume, which Glasynys has spelled
<i lang="cy">Bella</i> in <i lang="cy">Cymru Fu</i>.</p>
<p>So I wrote in 1881: since then I have ascertained from Professor
Joseph Wright, who is busily engaged on his great <i>English Dialect
Dictionary</i>, that <i>frit</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e3926src"
href="#xd26e3926" name="xd26e3926src">27</a> is the same word, in the
dialects of Cheshire, Shropshire, and Pembrokeshire, as <i>fright</i>
in literary English; and that the corresponding verb to <i>frighten</i>
is in them <i>fritten</i>, while a <i>frittenin</i> (= the book English
<i>frightening</i>) means a ghost or apparition. So <i lang=
"cy">s&igrave;li ffrit</i> is simply the English <i>silly frit</i>, and
means probably a silly sprite or silly ghost, and <i lang=
"cy">s&igrave;li ffrit Leisa B&egrave;la</i> would mean the silly ghost
of a woman called Liza Bella. But the silly frit found spinning near
Corwrion Pool will come under notice again, for that fairy belongs to
the Rumpelstiltzchen group of tales, and the fragment of a story about
her will be seen to have treated Silly Frit as her proper name, which
she had not intended to reach the ears of the person of whom she was
trying to get the better.</p>
<p>These tales are brought into connexion with the present day in more
ways than one, for besides the various accounts of the <i lang=
"cy">bwganod</i> or bogies of Corwrion frightening people when out late
at night, Mr. D. E. Davies knows a man, who is still living, and who
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb67" href="#v1pb67" name=
"v1pb67">67</a>]</span>well remembers the time when the sound of
working used to be heard in the pool, and the voices of children crying
somewhere in its depths, but that when people rushed there to see what
the matter was, all was found profoundly quiet and still. Moreover,
there is a family or two, now numerously represented in the parishes of
&#7930;andegai and &#7930;an&#7931;echid, who used to be taunted with
being the offspring of fairy ancestors. One of these families was
nicknamed &lsquo;Simychiaid&rsquo; or &lsquo;Smychiaid&rsquo;; and my
informant, who is not yet quite forty, says that he heard his mother
repeat scores of times that the old people used to say, that the
Smychiaid, who were very numerous in the neighbourhood, were descended
from fairies, and that they came from &#7930;yn Corwrion. At all this
the Smychiaid were wont to grow mightily angry. Another tradition, he
says, about them was that they were a wandering family that arrived in
the district from the direction of Conway, and that the father&rsquo;s
name was a Simwch, or rather that was his nickname, based on the proper
name Simwnt, which appears to have once been the prevalent name in
&#7930;andegai. The historical order of these words would in that case
have been <i lang="cy">Simwnt</i>, <i lang="cy">Simwch</i>, <i lang=
"cy">Simychiaid</i>, <i lang="cy">Smychiaid</i>. Now <i lang=
"cy">Simwnt</i> seems to be merely the Welsh form given to some such
English name as <i>Simond</i>, just as <i>Edmund</i> or <i>Edmond</i>
becomes in North Wales <i lang="cy">Emwnt</i>. The objection to the
nickname seems to lie in the fact, which one of my correspondents
points out to me, that Simwch is understood to mean a monkey, a point
on which I should like to have further information. Pughe gives
<i lang="cy">simach</i>, it is true, as having the meaning of the Latin
<i lang="la">simia</i>. A branch of the same family is said to be
called &lsquo;y Cowperiaid&rsquo; or the Coopers, from an ancestor who
was either by name or by trade a cooper. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb68" href="#v1pb68" name="v1pb68">68</a>]</span>Mr. Hughes&rsquo;
account of the Smychiaid was, that they are the descendants of one
Simonds, who came to be a bailiff at Bodysga&#7931;an, near Deganwy,
and moved from there to Coetmor in the neighbourhood of Corwrion.
Simonds was obnoxious to the bards, he goes on to say, and they
described the Smychiaid as having arrived in the parish at the bottom
of a <i lang="cy">cawe&#7931;</i>, &lsquo;a creel or basket carried on
the back,&rsquo; when chance would have it that the <i lang=
"cy">cawe&#7931;</i> cord snapped just in that neighbourhood, at a
place called Pont y &#7930;an. That accident is described, according to
Mr. Hughes, in the following doggerel, the origin of which I do not
know&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>E dorai &rsquo;r arwest, ede wan,</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>Brwnt y &#7931;e, ar Bont y &#7930;an.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">The cord would snap, feeble yarn,</p>
<p class="line">At that nasty spot, Pont y &#7930;an.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">Curiously enough, the same <i lang=
"cy">cawe&#7931;</i> story used to be said of a widely spread family in
North Cardiganshire, whose surname was pronounced Massn and written
Mason or Mazon: as my mother was of this family, I have often heard it.
The <i lang="cy">cawe&#7931;</i>, if I remember rightly, was said, in
this instance, to have come from Scotland, to which were traced three
men who settled in North Cardiganshire. One had no descendants, but the
other two, Mason and Peel&mdash;I think his name was Peel, but I am
only sure that it was not Welsh&mdash;had so many, that the Masons, at
any rate, are exceedingly numerous there; but a great many of them,
owing to some extent, probably, to the <i lang="cy">cawe&#7931;</i>
story, have been silly enough to change their name into that of Jones,
some of them in my time. The three men came there probably for refuge
in the course of troubles in Scotland, as a Frazer and a Francis did to
Anglesey. At any rate, I have never heard it suggested that they were
of aquatic origin, but, taking the <i lang="cy">cawe&#7931;</i> into
consideration, and the popular account of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb69" href="#v1pb69" name="v1pb69">69</a>]</span>the Smychiaid, I
should be inclined to think that the <i lang="cy">cawe&#7931;</i>
originally referred to some such a supposed descent. I only hope that
somebody will help us with another and a longer <i lang=
"cy">cawe&#7931;</i> tale, which will make up for the brevity of these
allusions. We may, however, assume, I think, that there was a tendency
at one time in Gwyne&#273;, if not in other parts of the Principality,
to believe, or pretend to believe, that the descendants of an
Englishman or Scotsman, who settled among the old inhabitants, were of
fairy origin, and that their history was somehow uncanny, which was
all, of course, duly resented. This helps, to some extent, to explain
how names of doubtful origin have got into these tales, such as
<i lang="cy">Smychiaid</i>, <i lang="cy">Cowperiaid</i>,
<i>Pellings</i>, <i>Penelope</i>, <i lang="cy">Leisa B&egrave;la</i> or
<i>Isabella</i>, and the like. This association of the lake legends
with intruders from without is what has, perhaps, in a great measure
served to rescue such legends from utter oblivion.</p>
<p>As to a church at Corwrion, the tradition does not seem to be an old
one, and it appears founded on one of the popular etymologies of the
word Corwrion, which treats the first syllable as <i lang="cy">cor</i>
in the sense of a choir; but the word has other meanings, including
among them that of an ox-stall or enclosure for cattle. Taking this as
coming near the true explanation, it at once suggests itself, that
Creuwyryon in the <i>Mabinogi</i> of Math ab Mathonwy is the same
place, for <i lang="cy">creu</i> or <i lang="cy">crau</i> also meant an
enclosure for animals, including swine. In Irish the word is <i lang=
"cy">cr&oacute;</i>, an enclosure, a hut or hovel. The passage in the
<i>Mabinogi</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e4101src" href="#xd26e4101"
name="xd26e4101src">28</a> relates to Gwydion returning with the swine
he had got by dint of magic and deceit from Pryderi, prince of Dyfed,
and runs thus in Lady Charlotte Guest&rsquo;s translation: &lsquo;So
they journeyed on to the highest town of Ar&#7931;echwe&#273;,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb70" href="#v1pb70" name=
"v1pb70">70</a>]</span>and there they made a sty (<i lang=
"cy">creu</i>) for the swine, and therefore was the name of Creuwyryon
given to that town.&rsquo; As to <i lang="cy">wyryon</i> or <i lang=
"cy">wyrion</i>, which we find made into <i lang="cy">wrion</i> in
Corwrion according to the modern habit, it would seem to be no other
word than the usual plural of <i lang="cy">wyr</i>, a grandson,
formerly also any descendant in the direct line. If so, the name of an
ancestor must have originally followed, just as one of the places
called Bettws was once <i lang="cy">Betws Wyrion I&#273;on</i>,
&lsquo;the Bettws of I&#273;on&rsquo;s Descendants&rsquo;; but it is
possible that <i lang="cy">wyrion</i> in Creu- or Cor-wyrion was itself
a man&rsquo;s name, though I have never met with it. It is right to add
that the name appears in the <i>Record of Carnarvon</i> (pp. 12, 25,
26) as Creweryon, which carries us back to the first half of the
fourteenth century. There it occurs as the name of a township
containing eight gavels, and the particulars about it might, in the
hand of one familiar with the tenures of that time, perhaps give us
valuable information as to what may have been its status at a still
earlier date.</p>

<p class="first">Here, for the sake of comparison with the Northwalian
stories in which the fairy wife runs away from her husband in
consequence of his having unintentionally touched or hit her with the
iron in the bridle, the fetter, or the stirrup, as on pp. 35, 40, 46,
50, 54, 61. I wish to cite the oldest recorded version, namely from
Walter Mapes&rsquo; curious miscellany of anecdotes and legends
entitled <i lang="la">De Nugis Curialium Distinctiones Quinque</i>.
Mapes flourished in the latter part of the twelfth century, and in
<i lang="la">Distinctio</i> ii. 11 of Thomas Wright&rsquo;s edition,
published in the year 1850, one reads the following story, which serves
the purpose there of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb71" href=

Uagelauc.</i></p>
<p>&lsquo;The Welsh relate to us another thing, not so much a miracle
as a portent, as follows. They say that Gwestin of Gwestiniog dwelt
beside Brecknock Mere, which has a circumference of two miles, and that
on three moonlight nights he saw in his field of oats women dancing,
and that he followed them until they sank in the water of the mere; but
the fourth time they say that he seized hold of one of them. Her captor
further used to relate that on each of these nights he had heard the
women, after plunging into the mere, murmuring beneath the water and
saying, &ldquo;If he had done so and so, he would have caught one of
us,&rdquo; and that he had been instructed by their own words,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb72" href="#v1pb72" name=
"v1pb72">72</a>]</span>as to the manner in which he caught her. She
both yielded and became his wife, and her first words to her husband
were these: &ldquo;Willingly will I serve thee, and with whole-hearted
obedience, until that day when, desirous of sallying forth in the
direction of the cries beyond the &#7930;yfni, thou shalt strike me
with thy bridle&rdquo;&mdash;the &#7930;yfni is a burn near the mere.
And this came to pass: after presenting him with a numerous offspring
she was struck by him with the bridle, and on his returning home, he
found her running away with her offspring, and he pursued her, but it
was with difficulty that he got hold even of one of his sons, and he
was named Trinio (?) Faglog.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The story, as it proceeds, mentions Trinio engaged in battle with
the men of a prince who seems to have been no other than Brychan of
Brycheiniog, supposed to have died about the middle of the fifth
century. The battle was disastrous to Trinio and his friends, and
Trinio was never seen afterwards; so Walter Mapes reports the fact that
people believed him to have been rescued by his mother, and that he was
with her living still in the lake. Giraldus calls it <i lang="la">lacus
ille de Brecheniauc magnus et famosus, quem et Clamosum dicunt</i>,
&lsquo;that great and famous lake of Brecknock which they also call
<i>Clamosus</i>,&rsquo; suggested by the Welsh <i lang="cy">&#7930;yn
&#7930;efni</i>, so called from the river <i lang="cy">&#7930;efni</i>,
misinterpreted as if derived from <i lang="cy">&#7931;ef</i> &lsquo;a
cry.&rsquo; With this lake he connects the legend, that at the bidding
of the rightful Prince of Wales, the birds frequenting it would at once
warble and sing. This he asserts to have been proved in the case of
Gruffu&#273;, son of Rhys, though the Normans were at the time masters
of his person and of his territory<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4192src"
href="#xd26e4192" name="xd26e4192src">29</a>. After dwelling on the
varying colours of the lake he adds the following
statement:&mdash;<i lang="la">Ad h&aelig;c <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb73" href="#v1pb73" name=
"v1pb73">73</a>]</span>etiam totus &aelig;dificiis consertus, culturis
egregiis, hortis ornatus et pomeriis, ab accolis quandoque
conspicitur</i>, &lsquo;Now and then also it is seen by the
neighbouring inhabitants to be covered with buildings, and adorned with
excellent farming, gardens, and orchards.&rsquo; It is remarkable as
one of the few lakes in Wales where the remains of a crannog have been
discovered, and while Mapes gives it as only two miles round, it is now
said to be about five; so it has sometimes<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4206src" href="#xd26e4206" name="xd26e4206src">30</a> been
regarded as a stockaded island rather than as an instance of pile
dwellings.</p>
<p>In the <i lang="cy">Brython</i> for 1863, pp. 114&ndash;15, is to be
found what purports to be a copy of a version of the Legend of
&#7930;yn Syfa&#273;on, as contained in a manuscript of Hugh
Thomas&rsquo; in the British Museum. It is to the effect that the
people of the neighbourhood have a story that all the land now covered
by the lake belonged to a princess, who had an admirer to whom she
would not be married unless he procured plenty of gold: she did not
care how. So he one day murdered and robbed a man who had money, and
the princess then accepted the murderer&rsquo;s suit, but she felt
uneasy on account of the reports as to the murdered man&rsquo;s ghost
haunting the place where his body had been buried. So she made her
admirer go at night to interview the ghost and lay it. Whilst he waited
near the grave he heard a voice inquiring whether the innocent man was
not to be avenged, and another replying that it would not be avenged
till the ninth generation. The princess and her lover felt safe enough
and were married: they multiplied and became numerous, while their town
grew to be as it were another Sodom; and the original pair lived on so
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb74" href="#v1pb74" name=
"v1pb74">74</a>]</span>astonishingly long that they saw their
descendants of the ninth generation. They exulted in their prosperity,
and one day held a great feast to celebrate it; and when their
descendants were banqueting with them, and the gaiety and mirth were at
their zenith, ancestors and descendants were one and all drowned in a
mighty cataclysm which produced the present lake.</p>
<p>Lastly may be briefly mentioned the belief still lingering in the
neighbourhood, to the effect that there is a town beneath the waters of
the lake, and that in rough weather the bells from the church tower of
that town may be heard ringing, while in calm weather the spire of the
church may be distinctly seen. My informant, writing in 1892, added the
remark: &lsquo;This story seems hardly creditable to us, but many of
the old people believe it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I ought to have mentioned that the fifteenth-century poet Lewis Glyn
Cothi connects with Syfa&#273;on<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4223src"
href="#xd26e4223" name="xd26e4223src">31</a> Lake an <i lang=

light of the more complete one from the banks of the river Conwy. So

the spelling of Welsh names, it may be pointed out for the benefit of
English readers that Welsh <i>f</i> has the sound of English <i>v</i>,
while the sound of English <i>f</i> is written <i>ff</i> (and

written <i>f</i> should be sounded <i>v</i>, it is borrowed from an old
English alphabet which did so likewise more or less systematically.
<i>Th</i> in such English words as <i>thin</i> and <i>breath</i> is
written <i>th</i>, but the soft sound as in <i>this</i> and

the Welsh form of the borrowed name <i>Jane</i>, and its pronunciation
in North Cardiganshire is Si&#815;&acirc;n, with si&#815; pronounced
approximately like the <i>ti</i> of such French words as <i>nation</i>

taught at school. This happens in North Wales, even in districts where
there are still plenty of people who cannot approach the English words
<i>fish</i> and <i>shilling</i> nearer than <i>fiss</i> and

considered old-fashioned and superseded by John and Jane, which I
learned to pronounce Dsi&#815;&ograve;n and Dsi&#815;&ecirc;n, except

general chaos of Anglo-Hebrew ones, such as Jones, Davies, and
Williams, which cover the Principality. Welsh place-names have
similarly been threatened by Hebrew names of chapels, such as Bethesda,

Mr. Robert Isaac Jones, at Tremadoc, in the years 1858&ndash;1863, and
edited by the Rev. Chancellor Silvan Evans, who was then the curate of
&#7930;ang&iuml;an in &#7930;eyn: in fact he was curate for fourteen
years! His excellent work in editing the <i lang="cy">Brython</i>
earned for him his diocesan&rsquo;s displeasure, but it is easier to
imagine than to describe how hard it was for him to resign the
honorarium of &pound;24 derived from the <i lang="cy">Brython</i> when
his stipend as a clergyman was only &pound;92, at the same time that he
had dependent on him a wife and six children. However much some people
affect to laugh at the revival of the national spirit in Wales, we
have, I think, got so far as to make it, for some time to come,
impossible for a Welsh clergyman to be snubbed on account of his
literary tastes or his delight in the arch&aelig;ology of his
country.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd26e3462src">&uarr;</a></p>

that the story of the wickedness of the ancient lord of Syfa&#273;on is
assigned as the reason why &lsquo;the superstitious little river
Lewenny will not mix its water with that of the lake.&rsquo;
<i>Lewenny</i> is a reckless improvement of Mapes&rsquo; <i>Leueni</i>
(printed <i>Lenem</i>); and Giraldus&rsquo; <i>Clamosum</i> implies an
old spelling <i lang="cy">&#7930;efni</i>, pronounced the same as the
later spelling <i lang="cy">&#7930;yfni</i>, which is now made into
<i lang="cy">&#7930;ynfi</i> or <i lang="cy">&#7930;ynvi</i>: the river
so called flows through the lake and into the Wye at Glasbury. As to
<i lang="cy">Safa&#273;an</i> or <i lang="cy">Syfa&#273;on</i>, it is
probably of Goidelic origin, and to be identified with such an Irish
name as the feminine <i lang="ga">Samthann</i>: see Dec. 19 in the
Martyrologies. To keep within our data, we are at liberty to suppose
that this was the name of the wicked princess in the story, and that
she was the ancestress of a clan once powerful on and around the lake,
which lies within a Goidelic area indicated by its Ogam
inscriptions.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

<p class="first">The best living authority I have found on the folklore
of Be&#273;gelert, Drws y Coed, and the surrounding district, is Mr.
William Jones, of &#7930;ango&#7931;en. He has written a good deal on
the subject in the <i lang="cy">Brython</i>, and in essays intended for
competition at various literary meetings in Wales. I had the loan from
him of one such essay, and I have referred to the <i lang=
"cy">Brython</i>; and I have also had from Mr. Jones a number of
letters, most of which contain some additional information. In harmony,
moreover, with my usual practice, I have asked Mr. Jones to give me a
little of his own history. This he has been kind enough to do; and, as
I have so far followed no particular order in these jottings, I shall
now give the reader the substance of his letters in English, as I am
anxious that no item should be lost or left inaccessible to English
students of folklore. What is unintelligible to me may not be so to
those who have made a serious study of the subject. Mr. Jones&rsquo;
words are in substance to the following effect:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was bred and born in the parish of Be&#273;gelert,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb76" href="#v1pb76" name=
"v1pb76">76</a>]</span>one of the most rustic neighbourhoods and least
subject to change in the whole country. Some of the old Welsh customs
remained within my memory, in spite of the adverse influence of the
Calvinistic Reformation, as it is termed, and I have myself witnessed
several Knitting Nights and Nuptial Feasts (<i lang=
"cy">Neithiorau</i>), which, be it noticed, are not to be confounded
with weddings, as they were feasts which followed the weddings, at the
interval of a week. At these gatherings song and story formed an
element of prime importance in the entertainment at a time when the
Reformation alluded to had already blown the blast of extinction on the
Merry Nights (<i lang="cy">Noswyliau &#7930;awen</i>) and Saints&rsquo;
F&ecirc;tes<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4316src" href="#xd26e4316" name=
"xd26e4316src">1</a> (<i lang="cy">Gwyliau Mabsant</i>) before the days
of my youth, though many of my aged acquaintances remembered them well,
and retained a vivid recollection of scores of the amusing tales which
used to be related for the best at the last mentioned long-night
meetings. I have heard not a few of them reproduced by men of that
generation. As an example of the old-fashioned habits of the people of
Be&#273;gelert in my early days, I may mention the way in which wives
and children used to be named. The custom was that the wife never took
her husband&rsquo;s family name, but retained the one she had as a
spinster. Thus my grandmother on my mother&rsquo;s side was called
Ellen Hughes, daughter to Hugh Williams, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb77" href="#v1pb77" name="v1pb77">77</a>]</span>of Gwastad Annas.
The name of her husband, my grandfather, was William Prichard [= <i>W.
ab Rhisiart</i>, or Richard&rsquo;s son], son to Richard William, of
the Efail Newy&#273;. The name of their eldest son, my uncle (brother
to my mother), was Hugh Hughes, and the second son&rsquo;s name was
Richard William. The mother had the privilege of naming her first-born
after her own family in case it was a boy; but if it happened to be a
girl, she took her name from the father&rsquo;s family, for which
reason my mother&rsquo;s maiden name was Catharine Williams. This
remained her name to the day of her death: and the old people at
Be&#273;gelert persisted in calling me, so long as I was at home,
William Prichard, after my grandfather, as I was my mother&rsquo;s
eldest child.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Most of the tales I have collected,&rsquo; says Mr. Jones,
&lsquo;relate to the parishes of Be&#273;gelert and Dolwy&#273;elen. My
kindred have lived for generations in those two parishes, and they are
very numerous: in fact, it used to be said that the people of
Dolwy&#273;elen and Be&#273;gelert were all cousins. They were mostly
small farmers, and jealous of all strangers, so that they married
almost without exception from the one parish into the other. This
intermixture helped to carry the tales of the one parish to the other,
and to perpetuate them on the hearths of their homes from generation to
generation, until they were swept away by another influence in this
century. Many of my ancestors seem to have been very fond of stories,
poetry, and singing, and I have been told that some of them were very
skilled in these things. So also, in the case of my parents, the memory
of the past had a great charm for them on both sides; and when the
relatives from Dolwy&#273;elen and Be&#273;gelert met in either parish,
there used to be no end to the recounting of pedigrees and the
repeating of tales for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb78" href=
"#v1pb78" name="v1pb78">78</a>]</span>the best. By listening to them, I
had been filled with desire to become an adept in pedigrees and
legends. My parents used to let me go every evening to the house of my
grandfather, William ab Rhisiart, the clerk, to listen to tales, and to
hear edifying books read. My grandfather was a reader &ldquo;without
his rival,&rdquo; and &ldquo;he used to beat the parson hollow.&rdquo;
Many people used to meet at Pen y Bont in the evenings to converse
together, and the stories of some of them were now and then exceedingly
eloquent. Of course, I listened with eager ears and open mouth, in
order, if I heard anything new, to be able to repeat it to my mother.
She, unwilling to let herself be beaten, would probably relate another
like it, which she had heard from her mother, her grandmother, or her
old aunt of Gwastad Annas, who was a fairly good verse-wright of the
homely kind. Then my father, if he did not happen to be busy with his
music-book, would also give us a tale which he had heard from his
grandmother or grandfather, the old John Jones, of Tyn &#7930;an
Dolwy&#273;elen, or somebody else would do so. That is one source from
which I got my knowledge of folklore; but this ceased when we moved
from Be&#273;gelert to Carnarvon in the year 1841. My grandfather died
in 1844, aged seventy-eight.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Besides those,&rsquo; Mr. Jones goes on to say, &lsquo;who
used to come to my grandfather&rsquo;s house and to his workshop to
relate stories, the blacksmith&rsquo;s shop used to be, especially on a
rainy day, a capital place for a story, and many a time did I lurk
there instead of going to school, in order to hear old William
Dafy&#273;, the sawyer, who, peace be to his ashes! drank many a
hornful from the <i>Big Quart</i> without ever breaking down, and old
Ifan Owen, the fisherman, tearing away for the best at their yarns,
sometimes a tissue of lies and sometimes truth. The former was funny,
and a great wag, up to all kinds <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb79"
href="#v1pb79" name="v1pb79">79</a>]</span>of tricks. He made everybody
laugh, whereas the latter would preserve the gravity of a saint,
however lying might be the tale which he related. Ifan Owen&rsquo;s
best stories were about the Water Spirit, or, as he called it, <i lang=
"cy">&#7930;amhigyn y Dwr</i>, &ldquo;the Water Leaper.&rdquo; He had
not himself seen the <i lang="cy">&#7930;amhigyn</i>, but his father
had seen it &ldquo;hundreds of times.&rdquo; Many an evening it had
prevented him from catching a single fish in &#7930;yn Gwynan, and,
when the fisherman got on this theme, his eloquence was apt to become
highly polysyllabic in its adjectives. Once in particular, when he had
been angling for hours towards the close of the day, without catching
anything, he found that something took the fly clean off the hook each
time he cast it. After moving from one spot to another on the lake, he
fished opposite the Benlan Wen, when something gave his line a
frightful pull, &ldquo;and, by the gallows, I gave another pull,&rdquo;
the fisherman used to say, &ldquo;with all the force of my arm: out it
came, and up it went off the hook, whilst I turned round to see, as it
dashed so against the cliff of Benlan that it blazed like a
lightning.&rdquo; He used to add, &ldquo;If that was not the <i lang=
"cy">&#7930;amhigyn</i>, it must have been the very devil
himself.&rdquo; That cliff must be two hundred yards at least from the
shore. As to his father, he had seen the Water Spirit many times, and
he had also been fishing in the &#7930;yn Gl&acirc;s or Ffynnon
L&acirc;s, once upon a time, when he hooked a wonderful and fearful
monster: it was not like a fish, but rather resembled a toad, except
that it had a tail and wings instead of legs. He pulled it easily
enough towards the shore, but, as its head was coming out of the water,
it gave a terrible shriek that was enough to split the
fisherman&rsquo;s bones to the marrow, and, had there not been a friend
standing by, he would have fallen headlong into the lake, and been
possibly dragged like a sheep into <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb80" href="#v1pb80" name="v1pb80">80</a>]</span>the depth; for
there is a tradition that if a sheep got into the &#7930;yn Gl&acirc;s,
it could not be got out again, as something would at once drag it to
the bottom. This used to be the belief of the shepherds of Cwm Dyli,
within my memory, and they acted on it in never letting their dogs go
after the sheep in the neighbourhood of this lake. These two funny
fellows, William Dafy&#273; and Ifan Owen, died long ago, without
leaving any of their descendants blessed with as much as the faintest
gossamer thread of the story-teller&rsquo;s mantle. The former, if he
had been still living, would now be no less than 129 years of age, and
the latter about 120.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Jones proceeds to say that he had stories from sources besides
those mentioned, namely, from Lowri Robart, wife of Rhisiart Edwart,
the &lsquo;Old Guide&rsquo;; from his old aunt of Gwastad Annas; from
William Wmffra, husband to his grandmother&rsquo;s sister; from his
grandmother, who was a native of Dolwy&#273;elen, but had been brought
up at Pw&#7931;gwernog, in Nanmor; from her sister; and from
Gruffu&#273; Prisiart, of Nanmor, afterwards of Glan Colwyn, who gave
him the legend of Owen Lawgoch of which I shall have something to say
later, and the story of the bogie of Pen Pwll Coch, which I do not
know. &lsquo;But the chief story-teller of his time at
Be&#273;gelert,&rsquo; Mr. Jones goes on to say, &lsquo;was Twm Ifan
Siams (pronounced Si&#815;&#259;ms or Sh&#259;ms), brother, I believe,
to Dafy&#273; Si&ocirc;n Siams, of the Penrhyn, who was a bard and
pedigree man. Twm lived at Nanmor, but I know not what his vocation
was; his relatives, however, were small farmers, carpenters, and
masons. It is not improbable that he was also an artisan, as he was
conversant with numbers, magnitude, and letters, and left behind him a
volume forming a pedigree book known at Nanmor as the <i lang=
"cy">Barcud Mawr</i>, or &ldquo;Great Kite,&rdquo; as Gruffu&#273;
Prisiart told me. The latter had been reading it many <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb81" href="#v1pb81" name="v1pb81">81</a>]</span>a
time in order to know the origin of somebody or other. All I can
remember of this character is that he was very old&mdash;over
90&mdash;and that he went from house to house in his old age to relate
tales and recount pedigrees: great was the welcome he had from
everybody everywhere. I remember, also, that he was small of stature,
nimble, witty, exceedingly amusing, and always ready with his say on
every subject. He was in the habit of calling on my grandfather in his
rambles, and very cordial was the reception which my parents always
gave him on account of his tales and his knowledge of pedigrees. The
story of the afanc, as given in my collection, is from his mouth. You
will observe how little difference there is between his
version<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4373src" href="#xd26e4373" name=
"xd26e4373src">2</a> and that known to Edward &#7930;wyd in the year
1695. I had related this story to a friend of mine at Portmadoc, who
was grandson or great-grandson to Dafy&#273; Si&ocirc;n Siams, of
Penrhyn, in 1858, when he called my attention to the same story in the
<i>Cambrian Journal</i> from the correspondence of Edward &#7930;wyd. I
was surprised at the similarity between the two versions, and I went to
Be&#273;gelert to Gruffu&#273; Rhisiart, who was related to Twm
Si&ocirc;n Siams. I read the story to him, and I found that he had
heard it related by his uncle just as it was by me, and as given in the
<i>Cambrian Journal</i>. Twm Ifan Siams had funny stories about the
tricks of <i lang="cy">Gwrach y Rhibyn</i>, the <i>Bodach<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4388src" href="#xd26e4388" name="xd26e4388src">3</a>
Glas</i>, and the <i lang="cy">Bwbach &#7930;wyd</i>, which he
localized in Nanmor and &#7930;anfrothen; he had, also, a very eloquent
tale about the courtship between a sailor from Moel y Gest, near
Portmadoc, and a mermaid, of which I retain a fairly <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb82" href="#v1pb82" name=
"v1pb82">82</a>]</span>good recollection. I believe Twm died in the
year 1835&ndash;6, aged about ninety-five.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So far, I have merely translated Mr. Jones&rsquo; account of himself
and his authorities as given me in the letter I have already referred
to, dated in June of last year, 1881. I would now add the substance of
his general remarks about the fairies, as he had heard them described,
and as he expressed himself in his essay for the competition on
folklore at the Carnarvon Eiste&#273;fod of 1880:&mdash;The traditions,
he says, respecting the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i> vary according to
the situation of the districts with which they are connected, and many
more such traditions continue to be remembered among the inhabitants of
the mountains than by those of the more level country. In some places
the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i> are described as a small folk of a
thieving nature, living in summer among the fern bushes in the
mountains, and in winter in the heather and gorse. These were wont to
frequent the fairs and to steal money from the farmers&rsquo; pockets,
where they placed in its stead their own fairy money, which looked like
the coin of the realm, but when it was paid for anything bought it
would vanish in the pockets of the seller. In other districts the
fairies were described as a little bigger and stronger folk; but these
latter were also of a thieving disposition. They would lurk around
people&rsquo;s houses, looking for an opportunity to steal butter and
cheese from the dairies, and they skulked about the cow-yards, in order
to milk the cows and the goats, which they did so thoroughly that many
a morning there was not a drop of milk to be had. The principal
mischief, however, which those used to do, was to carry away unbaptized
infants, and place in their stead their own wretched and peevish
offspring. They were said to live in hidden caves in the mountains, and
he had heard one old man asserting his firm <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb83" href="#v1pb83" name=
"v1pb83">83</a>]</span>belief that it was beneath Moel Eilio, also
called Moel Eilian, a mountain lying between &#7930;anberis and
Cwe&#7931;yn, the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i> of Nant y Bettws lived,
whom he had seen many a time when he was a lad; and, if any one came
across the mouth of their cave, he thought that he would find there a
wonderful amount of wealth, &lsquo;for they were thieves without their
like.&rsquo; There is still another species of <i lang="cy">Tylwyth
Teg</i>, very unlike the foregoing ones in their nature and habits. Not
only was this last kind far more beautiful and comely than the others,
but they were honest and good towards mortals. Their whole nature was
replete with joy and fun, nor were they ever beheld hardly, except
engaged in some merry-making or other. They might be seen on bright
moonlight nights at it, singing and carolling playfully on the fair
meadows and the green slopes, at other times dancing lightly on the
tops of the rushes in the valleys. They were also wont to be seen
hunting in full force on the backs of their grey horses; for this kind
were rich, and kept horses and servants. Though it used to be said that
they were spiritual and immortal beings, still they ate and drank like
human beings: they married and had children. They were also remarkable
for their cleanliness, and they were wont to reward neat maid-servants
and hospitable wives. So housewives used to exhort their maids to clean
their houses thoroughly every night before going to bed, saying that if
the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i> happened to enter, they would be sure
to leave money for them somewhere; but they were to tell no one in case
they found any, lest the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth</i> should be offended
and come no more. The mistresses also used to order a tinful of water
to be placed at the foot of the stairs, a clean cloth on the table,
with bread and its accompaniments (<i lang="cy">bara ac
en&#7931;yn</i>) placed on it, so that, if the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth</i>
came in to eat, the maids should <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb84"
href="#v1pb84" name="v1pb84">84</a>]</span>have their recompense on the
hob as well as unstinted praise for keeping the house clean, or, as Mr.
Jones has it in a couplet from Goronwy Owen&rsquo;s <i lang=
"cy">Cywy&#273; y Cynghorfynt</i>&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">

<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Finding the fairies&rsquo; pay on the hob,</p>
<p class="line">With full credit for a clean floor.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">Thus, whether the fairies came or not to pay a visit
to them during their sleep, the house would be clean by the morning,
and the table ready set for breakfast. It appears that the places most
frequently resorted to by this species were rushy combes surrounded by
smooth hills with round tops, also the banks of rivers and the borders
of lakes; but they were seldom seen at any time near rocks or cliffs.
So more tales about them are found in districts of the former
description than anywhere else, and among them may be mentioned
Penmachno, Dolwy&#273;elan, the sides of Moel Siabod,
&#7930;andeg&aacute;i Mountain, and from there to &#7930;anberis, to
Nant&#7931;e Lakes, to Moel Tryfan<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4448src"
href="#xd26e4448" name="xd26e4448src">4</a> and Nant y Bettws, the
upper portion of the parish of Be&#273;gelert from Drws y Coed to the
Pennant, and the district beginning from there and including the level
part of Eifion, on towards Celynnog Fawr. I have very little doubt that
there are many traditions about them in the neighbourhood of the Eifl
and in &#7930;eyn; I know but little, however, about these last. This
kind of fairies was said to live underground, and the way to their
country lay under hollow banks that overhung the deepest parts of the
lakes, or the deepest pools in the rivers, so that mortals could not
follow them further than the water, should they try to go after them.
They used to come out in broad daylight, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb85" href="#v1pb85" name="v1pb85">85</a>]</span>two or three
together, and now and then a shepherd, so the saying went, used to talk
and chat with them. Sometimes, moreover, he fell over head and ears in
love with their damsels, but they did not readily allow a mortal to
touch them. The time they were to be seen in their greatest glee was at
night when the moon was full, when they celebrated a merry night
(<i lang="cy">noswaith lawen</i>). At midnight to the minute, they
might be seen rising out of the ground in every combe and valley; then,
joining hands, they would form into circles, and begin to sing and
dance with might and main until the cock crew, when they would vanish.
Many used to go to look at them on those nights, but it was dangerous
to go too near them, lest they should lure the spectator into their
circle; for if that happened, they would throw a charm over him, which
would make him invisible to his companions, and he would be detained by
the fairies as long as he lived. At times some people went too near to
them, and got snatched in; and at other times a love-inspired youth,
fascinated by the charms of one of their damsels, rushed in foolhardily
to try to seize one of them, and became instantly surrounded and
concealed from sight. If he could be got out before the cock crew he
would be no worse; but once the fairies disappeared without his having
been released, he would never more be seen in the land of the living.
The way to get the captured man out was to take a long stick of
mountain ash (<i lang="cy">pren criafol</i>), which two or more strong
men had to hold with one of its ends in the middle of the circle, so
that when the man came round in his turn in the dance he might take
hold of it, for he is there bodily though not visible, so that he
cannot go past without coming across the stick. Then the others pull
him out, for the fairies, no more than any other spirit, dare touch the
mountain ash. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb86" href="#v1pb86"
name="v1pb86">86</a>]</span></p>
<p>We now proceed to give some of Mr. Jones&rsquo; legends. The first
is one which he published in the fourth volume of the <i lang=
"cy">Brython</i>, p. 70, whence the following free translation is made
of it:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In the north-west corner of the parish of Be&#273;gelert
there is a place which used to be called by the old inhabitants the
Land of the Fairies, and it reaches from Cwm Hafod Ruffy&#273; along
the slope of the mountain of Drws y Coed as far as &#7930;yn y
Dywarchen. The old people of former times used to find much pleasure
and amusement in this district in listening every moonlight night to
the charming music of the fair family, and in looking at their dancing
and their mirthful sports. Once on a time, a long while ago, there
lived at upper Drws y Coed a youth, who was joyous and active, brave
and determined of heart. This young man amused himself every night by
looking on and listening to them. One night they had come to a field
near the house, near the shore of &#7930;yn y Dywarchen, to pass a
merry night. He went, as usual, to look at them, when his glances at
once fell on one of the ladies, who possessed such beauty as he had
never seen in a human being. Her appearance was like that of alabaster;
her voice was as agreeable as the nightingale&rsquo;s, and as unruffled
as the zephyr in a flower-garden at the noon of a long summer&rsquo;s
day; and her gait was pretty and aristocratic; her feet moved in the
dance as lightly on the grass as the rays of the sun had a few hours
before on the lake hard by. He fell in love with her over head and
ears, and in the strength of that passion&mdash;for what is stronger
than love!&mdash;he rushed, when the bustle was at its height, into the
midst of the fair crowd, and snatched the graceful damsel in his arms,
and ran instantly with her to the house. When the fair family saw the
violence used by a mortal, they broke up the dance and ran after her
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb87" href="#v1pb87" name=
"v1pb87">87</a>]</span>towards the house; but, when they arrived, the
door had been bolted with iron, wherefore they could not get near her
or touch her in any way; and the damsel had been placed securely in a
chamber. The youth, having her now under his roof, as is the saying,
endeavoured, with all his talent, to win her affection and to induce
her to wed. But at first she would on no account hear of it; on seeing
his persistence, however, and on finding that he would not let her go
to return to her people, she consented to be his servant if he could
find out her name; but she would not be married to him. As he thought
that was not impossible, he half agreed to the condition; but, after
bothering his head with all the names known in that neighbourhood, he
found himself no nearer his point, though he was not willing to give up
the search hurriedly. One night, as he was going home from Carnarvon
market, he saw a number of the fair folks in a turbary not far from his
path. They seemed to him to be engaged in an important deliberation,
and it struck him that they were planning how to recover their abducted
sister. He thought, moreover, that if he could secretly get within
hearing, he might possibly find her name out. On looking carefully
around, he saw that a ditch ran through the turbary and passed near the
spot where they stood. So he made his way round to the ditch, and
crept, on all fours, along it until he was within hearing of the
family. After listening a little, he found that their deliberation was
as to the fate of the lady he had carried away, and he heard one of
them crying, piteously, &ldquo;O Penelop, O Penelop, my sister, why
didst thou run away with a mortal!&rdquo; &ldquo;Penelop,&rdquo; said
the young man to himself, &ldquo;that must be the name of my beloved:
that is enough.&rdquo; At once he began to creep back quietly, and he
returned home safely without having been seen by the fairies.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb88" href="#v1pb88" name=
"v1pb88">88</a>]</span>When he got into the house, he called out to the
girl, saying, &ldquo;Penelop, my beloved one, come here!&rdquo; and she
came forward and asked, in astonishment, &ldquo;O mortal, who has
betrayed my name to thee?&rdquo; Then, lifting up her tiny folded
hands, she exclaimed, &ldquo;Alas, my fate, my fate!&rdquo; But she
grew contented with her fate, and took to her work in earnest.
Everything in the house and on the farm prospered under her charge.
There was no better or cleanlier housewife in the neighbourhood around,
or one that was more provident than she. The young man, however, was
not satisfied that she should be a servant to him, and, after he had
long and persistently sought it, she consented to be married, on the
one condition, that, if ever he should touch her with iron, she would
be free to leave him and return to her family. He agreed to that
condition, since he believed that such a thing would never happen at
his hands. So they were married, and lived several years happily and
comfortably together. Two children were born to them, a boy and a girl,
the picture of their mother and the idols of their father. But one
morning, when the husband wanted to go to the fair at Carnarvon, he
went out to catch a filly that was grazing in the field by the house;
but for the life of him he could not catch her, and he called to his
wife to come to assist him. She came without delay, and they managed to
drive the filly to a secure corner, as they thought; but, as the man
approached to catch her, she rushed past him. In his excitement, he
threw the bridle after her; but, who should be running in the direction
of it, but his wife! The iron bit struck her on the cheek, and she
vanished out of sight on the spot. Her husband never saw her any more;
but one cold frosty night, a long time after this event, he was
awakened from his sleep by somebody rubbing the glass of his window,
and, after he had given <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb89" href=
"#v1pb89" name="v1pb89">89</a>]</span>a response, he recognized the
gentle and tender voice of his wife saying to him:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Lest my son should find it cold,</p>
<p class="line">Place on him his father&rsquo;s coat;</p>
<p class="line">Lest the fair one find it cold,</p>
<p class="line">Place on her my petticoat.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">It is said that the descendants of this family still
continue in these neighbourhoods, and that they are easy to be
recognized by their light and fair complexion. A similar story is
related of the son of the farmer of Braich y Dinas, in
&#7930;anfihangel y Pennant, and it used to be said that most of the
inhabitants of that neighbourhood were formerly of a light complexion.
I have often heard old people saying, that it was only necessary,
within their memory, to point out in the fair at Penmorfa any one as
being of the breed of the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth</i>, to cause plenty of
fighting that day at least.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The reader may compare with this tale the following, for which I
have to thank Mr. Samuel Rhys Williams, whose words I give, followed by
a translation:&mdash;</p>
<p lang="cy"><i>Yr oe&#273; gwr ieuanc o gymydogaeth Drws y Coed yn

<p>&lsquo;A young man, from the neighbourhood of Drws y Coed, was
returning home one bright moonlight night, from Be&#273;gelert; when he
came opposite the lake called &#7930;yn y Gader, he saw a number of the
ladies known as the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i> going through their
nightly frolics. The youth was charmed at once by the beauty of these
ladies, and especially by one of them. He so far lost his control over
himself, that he resolved to leap into the circle and carry away as his
spoil the one who had so completely robbed him of his heart. He
accomplished his intention, and carried the lady home with him. She
became his wife, and children were born to them. Accidentally, while at
some work or other, it happened to him to strike her with iron, and, in
the twinkling of an eye, his beloved one disappeared from his sight. He
saw her no more, except that she came to his bedroom window one night
afterwards, and told him to be tender to the children, and that she was
staying, near the house, in the lake called &#7930;yn y Dywarchen. The
tradition also informs us that this man moved from Drws y Coed to live
at Ystrad near Bettws Garmon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The name &#7930;yn y Dywarchen, I may add, means the Lake of the Sod
or Turf: it is the one with the floating island, described thus by
Giraldus, ii. 9 (p. 135):&mdash;<i lang="la">Alter enim insulam habet
erraticam, vi ventorum impellentium ad oppositas plerumque lacus partes
errabundam. Hic armenta pascentia nonnunquam pastores ad longinquas
subito partes translata mirantur.</i> &lsquo;For one of the two lakes
holds a wandering island, which strays mostly with the force of the
winds impelling it to the opposite parts of the lake. Sometimes cattle
grazing on it are, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb91" href="#v1pb91"
name="v1pb91">91</a>]</span>to the surprise of the shepherds, suddenly
carried across to the more distant parts.&rsquo; Sheep are known to get
on the floating islet, and it is still believed to float them away from
the shore. Mr. S. Rhys Williams, it will be noticed, has given the
substance of the legend rather than the story itself. I now proceed to
translate the same tale as given in Welsh in <i lang="cy">Cymru Fu</i>
(pp. 474&ndash;7 of the edition published by Messrs. Hughes and Son,
Wrexham), in a very different dress&mdash;it is from Glasynys&rsquo;
pen, and, as might be expected, decked out with all the literary
adornments in which he delighted. The language he used was his own, but
there is no reason to think that he invented any of the
incidents:&mdash;&lsquo;The farmer of Drws y Coed&rsquo;s son was one
misty day engaged as a shepherd on the side of the mountain, a little
below Cwm Marchnad, and, as he crossed a rushy flat, he saw a
wonderfully handsome little woman standing under a clump of rushes. Her
yellow and curly hair hung down in ringed locks, and her eyes were as
blue as the clear sky, while her forehead was as white as the wavy face
of a snowdrift that has nestled on the side of Snowdon only a single
night. Her two plump cheeks were each like a red rose, and her
pretty-lipped mouth might make an angel eager to kiss her. The youth
approached her, filled with love for her, and, with delicacy and
affection, asked her if he might converse with her. She smiled kindly,
and reaching out her hand, said to him, &ldquo;Idol of my hopes, thou
hast come at last!&rdquo; They began to associate secretly, and to meet
one another daily here and there on the moors around the banks of
&#7930;yn y Gader; at last, their love had waxed so strong that the
young man could not be at peace either day or night, as he was always
thinking of Bella or humming to himself a verse of poetry about her
charms. The yellow-haired youth was now and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb92" href="#v1pb92" name=
"v1pb92">92</a>]</span>then lost for a long while, and nobody could
divine his history. His acquaintances believed that he had been
fascinated: at last the secret was found out. There were about
&#7930;yn y Dywarchen shady and concealing copses: it was there he was
wont to go, and the she-elf would always be there awaiting him, and it
was therefore that the place where they used to meet got to be called
<i lang="cy">&#7930;wyn y Forwyn</i>, the Maiden&rsquo;s Grove. After
fondly loving for a long time, it was resolved to wed; but it was
needful to get the leave of the damsel&rsquo;s father. One moonlight
night it was agreed to meet in the wood, and the appointment was duly
kept by the young man, but there was no sign of the subterranean folks
coming, until the moon disappeared behind the Garn. Then the two
arrived, and the old man at once proceeded to say to the suitor:
&ldquo;Thou shalt have my daughter on the condition that thou do not
strike her with iron. If thou ever touch her with iron, she will no
longer be thine, but shall return to her own.&rdquo; The man consented
readily, and great was his joy. They were betrothed, and seldom was a
handsomer pair seen at the altar. It was rumoured that a vast sum of
money as dowry had arrived with the pretty lady at Drws y Coed on the
evening of her nuptials. Soon after, the mountain shepherd of Cwm
Marchnad passed for a very rich and influential man. In the course of
time they had children, and no happier people ever lived together than
their parents. Everything went on regularly and prosperously for a
number of years: they became exceedingly wealthy, but the sweet is not
to be had without the bitter. One day they both went out on horseback,
and they happened to go near &#7930;yn y Gader, when the wife&rsquo;s
horse got into a bog and sank to his belly. After the husband had got
Bella off his back, he succeeded with much trouble in getting the horse
out, and then <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb93" href="#v1pb93"
name="v1pb93">93</a>]</span>he let him go. Then he lifted her on the
back of his own, but, unfortunately, in trying quickly to place her
foot in the stirrup, the iron part of the same slipped, and struck
her&mdash;or, rather, it touched her at the knee-joint. Before they had
made good half their way home, several of the diminutive <i lang=
"cy">Tylwyth</i> began to appear to them, and the sound of sweet
singing was heard on the side of the hill. Before the husband reached
Drws y Coed his wife had left him, and it is supposed that she fled to
&#7930;wyn y Forwyn, and thence to the world below to Faery. She left
her dear little ones to the care of her beloved, and no more came near
them. Some say, however, that she sometimes contrived to see her
beloved one in the following manner. As the law of her country did not
permit her to frequent the earth with an earthly being, she and her
mother invented a way of avoiding the one thing and of securing the
other. A great piece of sod was set to float on the surface of the
lake, and on that she used to be for long hours, freely conversing in
tenderness with her consort on shore; by means of that plan they
managed to live together until he breathed his last. Their descendants
owned Drws y Coed for many generations, and they intermarried and mixed
with the people of the district. Moreover, many a fierce fight took
place in later times at the <i lang="cy">Gwyl-fabsant</i> at Dolbenmaen
or at Penmorfa, because the men of Eifiony&#273; had a habit of
annoying the people of Pennant by calling them Bellisians.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In a note, Glasynys remarks that this tale is located in many
districts without much variation, except in the names of the places;
this, however, could not apply to the latter part, which suits
&#7930;yn y Dywarchen alone. With this account of the fairy wife
frequenting a lake island to converse with her husband on shore,
compare the Irish story of the Children of Lir, who, though
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb94" href="#v1pb94" name=
"v1pb94">94</a>]</span>transformed into swans, were allowed to retain
their power of reasoning and speaking, so that they used to converse
from the surface of the water with their friends on the dry land: see
Joyce&rsquo;s <i>Old Celtic Romances</i>, pp. x, 1&ndash;36. Now I
return to another tale which was sent me by Mr. William Jones: unless I
am mistaken it has not hitherto been published; so I give the Welsh
together with a free translation of it:&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;There was a story respecting the son of the farmer of Braich
y Dinas, which used to be told by the late respected Mr. Ellis Owen, of
Cefn y Meusy&#273;, somewhat in the same way as that about the Ystrad
youth, as told by Glasynys; that is to say, the young man enticed one
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb96" href="#v1pb96" name=
"v1pb96">96</a>]</span>of the damsels of the fair family to come down
from Moel Hebog, and then he carried her by force into the house, and
afterwards persuaded her to become his wife on the same conditions as
the heir of Ystrad did. But I have heard an old lady called Mrs.
Roberts, who had been brought up at Isa&#7931;t, and who was older than
Mr. Owen, relating it differently. This old woman believed in the truth
of the story, as &ldquo;she remembered some of the family, whatever
anybody may say.&rdquo; She used to spin her yarn somewhat as
follows:&mdash;In old times&mdash;but, for the matter of that, when she
was a young woman&mdash;there were a great many of the fair family
living in certain caves in the Foel from Cwm <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e4551" title=
"Source: Stra&#7931;yn">Str&aacute;&#7931;yn</span><a class="noteref"
id="xd26e4553src" href="#xd26e4553" name="xd26e4553src">5</a> down to
the upper part of Pennant. This <i lang="cy">Tylwyth</i> was much
handsomer than any seen in any other part of the country. In point of
stature they were much bigger than the ordinary ones, fair of
complexion beyond everybody, with hair that was as light as flax, and
eyes that were of a clear blue colour. They showed themselves in one
spot or another, engaged in playing, singing, and jollity every light
night. The sound of their singing used to draw the lads and the young
women to look at them; and, should they be of clear complexion, the
fairies would chat with them; but they would let no person of a dark
hue come near them: they moved away from such a one. Now the young man
of Braich y Dinas was a handsome, vigorous, and lively stripling of
fair, clear, and attractive complexion. He was very fond of looking at
the fair family, and had a chat with some of them often, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb97" href="#v1pb97" name=
"v1pb97">97</a>]</span>but chiefly with one of the damsels, who
surpassed all the rest in beauty and good sense. The result of
frequently meeting was that they fell in love with one another, but she
would not marry him. She promised, however, to go to service to him,
and agreed to meet him at Pant y&mdash;I have forgotten the rest of the
name&mdash;the day after, as it would not do for her to go with him
while the others happened to be looking on. So he went up the next day
to the Foel, and the damsel met him according to her promise, and went
with him home, where she took to the duties of a dairymaid. Soon
everything began to prosper under her hand; the butter and the cheese
were daily growing in quantity. Long and importunately did the youth
try to get her to marry him. She promised to do so provided he could
find out her name. Mrs. Roberts did not know by what man&oelig;uvre he
succeeded in discovering it, but it was done, and he came into the
house one night and called to &ldquo;Sibi,&rdquo; and when she heard
her name she fainted away. When, however, she recovered her
consciousness, she consented to marry on the condition that he was not
to touch her with iron, and that there was not to be a bolt of iron on
the door, or a lock either. It was agreed, and they were married; they
lived together comfortably many years, and had children born to them.
The end came thus: he had gone one day to cut a bundle of rushes for
thatching, and planted the reaping-hook in the bundle to go home. As he
drew towards the haggard, Sibi ran out to meet him, and he wantonly
threw the bundle of rushes towards her, when she, to prevent its
hitting her, tried to stop it with her hand, which touched the
reaping-hook. She vanished on the spot out of sight behind the bundle
of rushes, and nothing more was seen or heard of her.&rsquo;

<p>Mr. Ellis Owen, alluded to above, was a highly respected gentleman,
well known in North Wales for his literary and antiquarian tastes. He
was born in 1789 at Cefn y Meusy&#273; near Tremadoc, where he
continued to live till the day of his death, which was January 27,
1868. His literary remains, preceded by a short biography, were
published in 1877 by Mr. Robert Isaac Jones of Tremadoc; but it
contains no fairy tales so far as I have been able to find.</p>
<p>A tale which partially reminds one of that given by Dewi Glan
Ffrydlas respecting the Corwrion midwife, referred to at p. 63 above,
was published by Mr. W. Jones in the fourth volume of the <i lang=
"cy">Brython</i>, p. 251: freely rendered into English, it runs
thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Once on a time, when a midwife from Nanhwynan had newly got
to the Hafo&#273;y&#273; Brithion to pursue her calling, a gentleman
came to the door on a fine grey steed and bade her come with him at
once. Such was the authority with which he spoke, that the poor midwife
durst not refuse to go, however much it was her duty to stay where she
was. So she mounted behind him, and off they went, like the flight of a
swallow, through Cwm&#7931;an, over the Bwlch, down Nant yr Aran, and
over the Gader to Cwm Hafod Ruffy&#273;, before the poor woman had time
even to say Oh! When they reached there, she saw before her a
magnificent mansion, splendidly lit up with such lamps as she had never
seen before. They entered the court, and a crowd of servants in
expensive liveries came to meet them, and she was at once led through
the great hall into a bed-chamber, the like of which she had never
seen. There the mistress of the house, to whom she had been fetched,
was awaiting her. The midwife got through her duties successfully, and
stayed there until the lady had completely recovered, nor had she spent
any part of her <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb99" href="#v1pb99"
name="v1pb99">99</a>]</span>life so merrily, for there nought but
festivity went on day and night: dancing, singing, and endless
rejoicing reigned there. But merry as it was, she found that she must
go, and the nobleman gave her a large purse, with the order not to open
it until she had got into her own house. Then he bade one of his
servants escort her the same way that she had come. When she reached
home she opened the purse, and, to her great joy, it was full of money:
she lived happily on those earnings to the end of her life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With this ending of the story one should contrast Dewi Glan
Ffrydlas&rsquo; tale to which I have already alluded; and I may here
refer to Mr. Sikes&rsquo; <i>British Goblins</i>, pp. 86&ndash;8, for a
tale differing from both Dewi&rsquo;s and Jones&rsquo;, in that the
fairies are there made to appear as devils to the nurse, who had
accidentally used a certain ointment which she was not to place near
her own eyes. Instead of being rewarded for her services she was only
too glad to be deposited anyhow near her home. &lsquo;But,&rsquo; as
the story goes on to relate, &lsquo;very many years afterwards, being
at a fair, she saw a man stealing something from a stall, and, with one
corner of her eye, beheld her old master pushing the man&rsquo;s elbow.
Unthinkingly she said, &ldquo;How are you, master? how are the
children?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;How did you see me?&rdquo; She
answered, &ldquo;With the corner of my left eye.&rdquo; From that
moment she was blind of her left eye, and lived many years with only
her right.&rsquo; Such is the end of this tale given by Mr. Sikes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But the fair family did not,&rsquo; Mr. William Jones goes on
to say, &lsquo;always give mortals the means of good living: sometimes
they made no little fun of them. Once on a time the Drws y Coed man was
going home from Be&#273;gelert Fair, rather merry than sad, along the
old road over the Gader, when he saw, on coming near <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb100" href="#v1pb100" name=
"v1pb100">100</a>]</span>the top of the Gader, a fine, handsome house
near the road, in which there was a rare merrymaking. He knew perfectly
well that there was no such a building anywhere on his way, and it made
him think that he had lost his way and gone astray; so he resolved to
turn into the house to ask for lodgings, which were given him. At once,
when he entered, he took it to be a nuptial feast (<i lang=
"cy">neithior</i>) by reason of the jollity, the singing, and the
dancing. The house was full of young men, young women, and children,
all merry, and exerting themselves to the utmost. The company began to
disappear one by one, and he asked if he might go to bed, whereupon he
was led to a splendid chamber, where there was a bed of the softest
down with snow-white clothes on it. He stripped at once, went into it,
and slept quietly enough till the morning. The first thing to come to
his mind when he lay half asleep, half awake, was the jollity of the
night before, and the fact of his sleeping in a splendid chamber in the
strange house. He opened his eyes to survey his bedroom, but it was too
wide: he was sleeping on the bare swamp, with a clump of rushes as his
pillow, and the blue sky as his coverlet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Jones mentions that, within his memory, there were still people
in his neighbourhood who believed that the fairies stole unbaptized
children and placed their own in their stead: he gives the following
story about the farmer&rsquo;s wife of Dyffryn Mymbyr, near Capel
Curig, and her infant:&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;This woman had given birth to a healthy and vigorous child at
the beginning of the harvest, one wretched and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb102" href="#v1pb102" name=
"v1pb102">102</a>]</span>inclement summer. As the homestead was a
considerable distance from church or chapel, and the weather so very
rainy, it was neglected to baptize the child at the usual<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4609src" href="#xd26e4609" name="xd26e4609src">6</a>
time, that is to say, before it was eight days old. One fine day, in
the middle of this wretched harvest, the mother went to the field with
the rest of the family to try to save the harvest, and left her baby
sleeping in its cradle in its grandmother&rsquo;s charge, who was so
aged and decrepit as to be unable to go much about. The old woman fell
asleep, and, while she was in that state, the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth
Teg</i> came in and took away the baby, placing another in its stead.
Very shortly the latter began to whine and groan, so that the
grandmother awoke: she went to the cradle, where she saw a slender,
wizened old man moving restlessly and peevishly about. &ldquo;Alas!
alas!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;the old <i lang="cy">Tylwyth</i> have
been here&rdquo;; and she at once blew in the horn to call the mother
home, who came without delay. As she heard the crying in the cradle,
she ran towards it, and lifted the little one without looking at him;
she hugged him, put him to her breast, and sang lullaby to him, but
nothing was of any avail, as he continued, without stopping, to scream
enough to break her heart; and she knew not what to do to calm him. At
last she looked at him: she saw that he was not like her dear little
boy, and her heart was pierced with agony. She looked at him again, and
the more she examined him the uglier he seemed to her. She sent for her
husband home from the field, and told him to search for a skilled man
somewhere or other; and, after a long search, he was told by somebody
that the parson of Trawsfyny&#273; was skilled in the secrets of the
spirits; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb103" href="#v1pb103" name=
"v1pb103">103</a>]</span>so he went to him. The latter bade him take a
shovel and cover it with salt, and make the figure of the cross in the
salt; then to take it to the chamber where the fairy child was, and,
after taking care to open the window, to place the shovel on the fire
until the salt was burnt. This was done, and when the salt had got
white hot, the peevish abortion went away, seen of no one, and they
found the other baby whole and unscathed at the doorstep.&rsquo; Fire
was also made use of in Scotland in order to detect a changeling and
force him to quit: see the British Association&rsquo;s <i>Report</i>,
1896, p. 650, where Mr. Gomme refers to Mr. Gregor&rsquo;s <i>Folk-lore
of the North-east of Scotland</i>, pp. 8&ndash;9.</p>
<p>In answer to a question of mine with regard to gossamer, which is
called in North Wales <i lang="cy">edafe&#273; gwawn</i>,
&lsquo;<i lang="cy">gwawn</i> yarn,&rsquo; Mr. Jones told me in a
letter, dated April, 1881, that it used to be called <i lang=
"cy">Rhaffau&rsquo;r Tylwyth Teg</i>, that is to say, the Ropes of the
Fair Family, which were associated with the diminutive, mischievous,
and wanton kind of fairies who dwelt in marshy and rushy places, or
among the fern and the heather. It used to be said that, if a man
should lie down and fall asleep in any such a spot, the fairies would
come and bind him with their ropes so that he could not move, and that
they would then cover him with a sheet made of their ropes, which would
make him invisible. This was illustrated by him by the following tale
he had heard from his mother:&mdash;</p>
<p lang="cy"><i>Clywais fy mam yn adro&#273; chwedl am fab y

<p>&lsquo;I have heard my mother relating a tale about the son of the
farmer of the Ffri&#273;, who, while on his way home from
Be&#273;gelert Fair, saw, somewhere near Pen Cae&rsquo;r Gors, an
endless number of the diminutive family leaping and capering on the
heather tops. He sat him down to look at them, and sleep came over him;
he let himself down on the ground, and slept heavily. When he was so,
the whole host attacked him, and they bound him so tightly that he
could not have stirred; then they covered him with the gossamer sheet,
so that nobody could see him in case he called for help. His people
expected him home early that evening, and, as they found him delaying
till late, they got uneasy about him. They went to meet him, but no
trace of him was seen, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb105" href=
"#v1pb105" name="v1pb105">105</a>]</span>and they went as far as the
village, where they were informed that he had started home in good time
with the farmer of Hafod Ruffy&#273;. So they went to the Hafod to see
if he was there; but the farmer told them that they had parted on Glan
y Gors Bridge to go to their respective homes. A minute search was then
made on both sides of the road from there to the Ffri&#273;, but
without finding any trace of him. They kept searching the whole
neighbourhood during the whole of the next day, but in vain. However,
about the same time the following night the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth</i>
came and liberated him, and he shortly woke up, after sleeping through
the previous night and day. When he woke he had no idea where on earth
he was; so he wandered about on the slopes of the Gader and near the
Gors Fawr until the cock crew, when he found where he was, namely, less
than a quarter of a mile from his home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The late Mr. Owen, of Cefn Meusy&#273;, has already been alluded to.
I have not been able to get at much of the folklore with which he was
familiar, but, in reply to some questions of mine, Mr. Robert Isaac
Jones of Tremadoc, his biographer, and the publisher of the <i lang=
"cy">Brython</i>, so long as it existed, has kindly ransacked his
memory. He writes to me in Welsh to the following effect:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will tell you what I heard from Mr. Owen and my mother when
I was a lad, about fifty-seven years ago. The former used to say that
the people of Pennant in Eifiony&#273; had a nickname, to wit, that of
<i lang="cy">Belsiaid y Pennant</i>, &ldquo;the Bellisians of the
Pennant&rdquo;; that, when he was a boy, if anybody called out <i lang=
"cy">Belsiaid y Pennant</i> at the Penmorfa Fair, every man jack of
them would come out, and fighting always ensued. The antiquary used to
explain it thus. Some two or three hundred years ago, Sir Robert of the
Nant, one of Sir Richard Bulkeley&rsquo;s ancestors, had a son and heir
who was extravagant <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb106" href=
"#v1pb106" name="v1pb106">106</a>]</span>and wild. He married a gipsy,
and they had children born to them; but, as the family regarded this
marriage as a disgrace to their ancient stem, it is said that the
father, the next time the vagabonds came round, gave a large sum of
money to the father of the girl for taking her away with him. This
having been done, the rumour was spread abroad that it was one of the
fairies the youth had married, and that she had gone with him to catch
a pony, when he threw the bridle at the beast to prevent it passing,
and the iron of the bridle touched the wife; then that she at once
disappeared, as the fairies always do so when touched with iron.
However, the two children were put out to nurse, and the one of them,
who was a girl, was brought up at Plas y Pennant, and her name was
<i>Pelisha</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e4668src" href="#xd26e4668"
name="xd26e4668src">7</a>; her descendants remain to this day in the
Nant, and are called Bellis, who are believed there, to this day, to be
derived from the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i>. Nothing offends them
more than to be reminded of this.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. R. I. Jones goes on to relate another tale as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p lang="cy"><i>Dywedir fod &#7931;e a elwir yr Hafod Rugog mewn cwm

"#v1pb107" name="v1pb107">107</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;It is said that there was a place called Hafod Rugog in a
wild hollow among the mountains, where the fair family were in the
habit of resorting, and that they used to trouble the old woman of
Hafod for the loan of one thing and another. So she said, one day,
&ldquo;You shall have the loan if you will grant me two first
things&mdash;that the first thing I touch at the door break, and that
the first thing I put my hand on in the house be lengthened half a
yard.&rdquo; There was a grip stone (<i lang="cy">carreg afael</i>), as
it is called, in the wall near the door, which was in her way, and she
had in the house a piece of flannel for a jerkin which was half a yard
too short. But, unfortunately, as she came, with her kreel full of turf
on her back, to the house, she nearly fell down: she put her hand, in
order to save herself, to her knee-joint, which then broke; and, owing
to the pain, when she had got into the house, she touched her nose with
her hand, when her nose grew half a yard longer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Jones went on to notice how the old folks used to believe that
the fairies were wont to appear in the marshes near Cwe&#7931;yn Lake,
not far from Rhyd-&#272;u, to sing and dance, and that it was
considered dangerous to approach them on those occasions lest one
should be fascinated. As to the above-mentioned flannel and stone a
folklorist asks me, why the old woman did not definitely mention them
and say exactly what she wanted. The question is worth asking: I cannot
answer it, but I mention it in the hope that somebody else will.</p>

<p class="first">Early in the year 1899<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4709src" href="#xd26e4709" name="xd26e4709src">8</a> I had a
small group of stories communicated to me by the Rev. W. Evans Jones,
rector of Dolbenmaen, who tells me that the neighbourhood <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb108" href="#v1pb108" name=
"v1pb108">108</a>]</span>of the Garn abounds in fairy tales. The scene
of one of these is located near the source of Afon fach Blaen y Cae, a
tributary of the Dwyfach. &lsquo;There a shepherd while looking after
his flock came across a ring of rushes which he accidentally kicked, as
the little people were coming out to dance. They detained him, and he
married one of their number. He was told that he would live happily
with them as long as he would not touch any instrument of iron. For
years nothing happened to mar the peace and happiness of the family.
One day, however, he unknowingly touched iron, with the consequence
that both the wife and the children disappeared.&rsquo; This differs
remarkably from stories such as have been already mentioned at pp. 32,
35; but until it is countenanced by stories from other sources, I can
only treat it as a blurred version of a story of the more usual type,
such as the next one which Mr. Evans Jones has sent me as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A son of the farmer of Blaen Pennant married a fairy and they
lived together happily for years, until one day he took a bridle to
catch a horse, which proved to be rather an obstreperous animal, and in
trying to prevent the horse passing, he threw the bridle at him, which,
however, missed the animal and hit the wife so that the bit touched
her, and she at once disappeared. The tradition goes, that their
descendants are to this day living in the Pennant Valley; and if there
is any unpleasantness between them and their neighbours they are
taunted with being of the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i> family.&rsquo;
These are, I presume, the people nicknamed <i lang="cy">Belsiaid</i>,
to which reference has already been made.</p>
<p>The next story is about an old woman from Garn Dolbenmaen who was
crossing y Graig Goch, &lsquo;the Red Rock,&rsquo; &lsquo;when suddenly
she came across a fairy sitting down with a very large number of gold
coins by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb109" href="#v1pb109" name=
"v1pb109">109</a>]</span>her. The old woman ventured to remark how
wealthy she was: the fairy replied, <i lang="cy">Wele dacw</i>,
&ldquo;Lo there!&rdquo; and immediately disappeared.&rsquo; This looks
as if it ought to be a part of a longer story which Mr. Evans Jones has
not heard.</p>
<p>The last bit of folklore which he has communicated is equally short,
but of a rarer description: &lsquo;A fairy was in the habit of
attending a certain family in the Pennant Valley every evening to put
the children to bed; and as the fairy was poorly clad, the mistress of
the house gave her a gown, which was found in the morning torn into
shreds.&rsquo; The displeasure of the fairy at being offered the gown
is paralleled by that of the fenodyree or the Manx brownie, described
in chapter iv. As for the kind of service here ascribed to the Pennant
fairy, I know nothing exactly parallel.</p>

<p class="first">The next four stories are to be found in <i lang=
"cy">Cymru Fu</i> at pp. 175&ndash;9, whence I have taken the liberty
of translating them into English. They were contributed by Glasynys,
whose name has already occurred so often in connexion with these Welsh
legends, that the reader ought to know more about him; but I have been
disappointed in my attempt to get a short account of his life to insert
here. All I can say is, that I made his acquaintance in 1865 in
Anglesey: at that time he had a curacy near Holyhead, and he was in the
prime of life. He impressed me as an enthusiast for Welsh antiquities:
he was born and bred, I believe, in the neighbourhood of Snowdon, and
his death took place about ten years ago. It would be a convenience to
the student of Welsh folklore to have a brief biography of Glasynys,
but as yet nothing of the kind seems to have been written. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb110" href="#v1pb110" name=

<p>(1) &lsquo;When the people of the Gors Goch one evening had just
gone to bed, they heard a great row and disturbance around the house.
One could not comprehend at all what it was that made a noise at that
time of night. Both the husband and the wife had waked up, quite unable
to make out what it might be. The children also woke, but no one could
utter a word: their tongues had all stuck to the roof of their mouths.
The husband, however, at last managed to move, and to ask, &ldquo;Who
is there? What do you want?&rdquo; Then he was answered from without by
a small silvery voice, &ldquo;It is room we want to dress our
children.&rdquo; The door was opened: a dozen small beings came in, and
began to search for an earthen pitcher with water; there they remained
for some hours, washing and titivating themselves. As the day was
breaking, they went away, leaving behind them a fine present for the
kindness they had received. Often afterwards did the Gors Goch folks
have the company of this family. But once there happened to be there a
fine plump and pretty baby in his cradle. The fair family came, and, as
the baby had not been baptized, they took the liberty of changing him
for one of their own. They left behind in his stead an abominable
creature that would do nothing but cry and scream every day of the
week. The mother was nearly breaking her heart on account of the
misfortune, and greatly afraid of telling anybody about it. But
everybody got to see that there was something wrong at the Gors Goch,
which was proved before long by the mother dying of longing for her
child. The other children died broken-hearted after their mother, and
the husband was left alone with the little elf without any one to
comfort them. But shortly after, one began to resort again to the
hearth of the Gors Goch to dress children, and the gift, which had
formerly been silver money, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb111"
href="#v1pb111" name="v1pb111">111</a>]</span>became henceforth pure
gold. In the course of a few years the elf became the heir of a large
farm in North Wales, and that is why the old people used to say,
&ldquo;Shoe the elf with gold and he will grow&rdquo; (<i lang="cy">Fe
&#273;aw gwi&#273;on yn fawr ond ei bedoli ag aur</i>). That is the
legend of the Gors Goch.&rsquo;</p>
<p>(2) &lsquo;Once when William Ellis, of the Gilwern, was fishing on
the bank of Cwm Silin Lake on a dark misty day, he had seen no living
Christian from the time when he left Nant&#7931;e. But as he was in a
happy mood, throwing his line, he beheld over against him in a clump of
rushes a large crowd of people, or things in the shape of people about
a foot in stature: they were engaged in leaping and dancing. He looked
on for hours, and he never heard, as he said, such music in his life
before. But William went too near them, when they threw a kind of dust
into his eyes, and, while he was wiping it away, the little family took
the opportunity of betaking themselves somewhere out of his sight, so
that he neither saw nor heard anything more of them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>(3) &lsquo;There is a similar story respecting a place called
&#7930;yn y Ffynhonnau. There was no end of jollity there, of dancing,
harping, and fiddling, with the servant man of Ge&#7931;i Ffrydau and
his two dogs in the midst of the crowd, leaping and capering as nimbly
as anybody else. At it they were for three days and three nights,
without stopping; and had it not been for a skilled man, who lived not
far off, and came to know how things were going on, the poor fellow
would, without doubt, have danced himself to death. But he was rescued
that time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>(4) The fourth story is one, of which he says, that he heard it from
his mother; but he has elaborated it in his usual fashion, and the
proper names are undoubtedly his own:&mdash;&lsquo;Once on a time, a
shepherd boy had gone <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb112" href=
"#v1pb112" name="v1pb112">112</a>]</span>up the mountain. That day,
like many a day before and after, was exceedingly misty. Now, though he
was well acquainted with the place, he lost his way, and walked
backwards and forwards for many a long hour. At last he got into a low
rushy spot, where he saw before him many circular rings. He at once
recalled the place, and began to fear the worst. He had heard, many
hundreds of times, of the bitter experiences, in those rings, of many a
shepherd who had happened to chance on the dancing place or the circles
of the fair family. He hastened away as fast as ever he could, lest he
should be ruined like the rest; but, though he exerted himself to the
point of perspiring and losing his breath, there he was, and there he
continued to be, a long time. At last he was met by an old fat little
man, with merry blue eyes, who asked him what he was doing. He answered
that he was trying to find his way home. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;come after me, and do not utter a word until I bid thee.&rdquo;
This he did, following him on and on until they came to an oval stone;
and the old fat little man lifted it, after tapping the middle of it
three times with his walking-stick. There was there a narrow path with
stairs visible here and there; and a sort of whitish light, inclining
to grey and blue, was to be seen radiating from the stones.
&ldquo;Follow me fearlessly,&rdquo; said the fat man; &ldquo;no harm
will be done thee.&rdquo; So on the poor youth went, as reluctantly as
a dog to be hanged. But presently a fine, wooded, fertile country
spread itself out before them, with well arranged mansions dotting it
all over, while every kind of apparent magnificence met the eye and
seemed to smile in the landscape; the bright waters of the rivers
meandered in twisted streams, and the hills were covered with the
luxuriant verdure of their grassy growth, and the mountains with a
glossy fleece of smooth pasture. By the time they had <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb113" href="#v1pb113" name=
"v1pb113">113</a>]</span>reached the stout gentleman&rsquo;s mansion,
the young man&rsquo;s senses had been bewildered by the sweet cadence
of the music which the birds poured forth from the groves: then there
was gold dazzling his eyes, and silver flashing on his sight. He saw
there all kinds of musical instruments and all sorts of things for
playing; but he could discern no inhabitant in the whole place; and,
when he sat down to eat, the dishes on the table came to their places
of themselves, and disappeared when one had done with them. This
puzzled him beyond measure; moreover, he heard people talking together
around him, but for the life of him he could see no one but his old
friend. At length the fat man said to him: &ldquo;Thou canst now talk
as much as it may please thee;&rdquo; but, when he attempted to move
his tongue, it would no more stir than if it had been a lump of ice,
which greatly frightened him. At this point, a fine old lady, with
health and benevolence beaming in her face, came to them and slightly
smiled at the shepherd: the mother was followed by her three daughters,
who were remarkably beautiful. They gazed with somewhat playful looks
at him, and at length began to talk to him; but his tongue would not
wag. Then one of the girls came to him, and, playing with his yellow
and curly locks, gave him a smart kiss on his ruddy lips. This loosened
the string that bound his tongue, and he began to talk freely and
eloquently. There he was, under the charm of that kiss, in the bliss of
happiness; and there he remained a year and a day without knowing that
he had passed more than a day among them; for he had got into a country
where there was no reckoning of time. But by-and-by he began to feel
somewhat of a longing to visit his old home, and asked the stout man if
he might go. &ldquo;Stay a little yet,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and thou
shalt go for awhile.&rdquo; That passed: he stayed on, but Olwen,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb114" href="#v1pb114" name=
"v1pb114">114</a>]</span>for that was the name of the damsel that had
kissed him, was very unwilling that he should depart. She looked sad
every time he talked of going away; nor was he himself without feeling
a sort of a cold thrill passing through him at the thought of leaving
her. On condition, however, of returning, he obtained leave to go,
provided with plenty of gold and silver, of trinkets and gems. When he
reached home, nobody knew who he was: it had been the belief that he
had been killed by another shepherd, who found it necessary to betake
himself hastily far away to America, lest he should be hanged without
delay. But here is Einion L&acirc;s at home, and everybody wonders
especially to see that the shepherd had got to look like a wealthy man:
his manners, his dress, his language, and the treasure he had with him,
all conspired to give him the air of a gentleman. He went back one
Thursday night, the first of the moon of that month, as suddenly as he
had left the first time, and nobody knew whither. There was great joy
in the country below when Einion returned thither, and nobody was more
rejoiced at it than Olwen his beloved. The two were right impatient to
get married; but it was necessary to do that quietly, for the family
below hated nothing more than fuss and noise; so, in a sort of a
half-secret fashion, they were wedded. Einion was very desirous to go
once more among his own people, accompanied, to be sure, by his wife.
After he had been long entreating the old man for leave, they set out
on two white ponies, that were, in fact, more like snow than anything
else in point of colour. So he arrived with his consort in his old
home, and it was the opinion of all that Einion&rsquo;s wife was the
handsomest person they had anywhere seen. Whilst at home, a son was
born to them, to whom they gave the name of Taliessin. Einion was now
in the enjoyment of high <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb115" href=
"#v1pb115" name="v1pb115">115</a>]</span>repute, and his wife received
due respect. Their wealth was immense, and soon they acquired a large
estate; but it was not long till people began to inquire after the
pedigree of Einion&rsquo;s wife: the country was of opinion that it was
not the right thing to be without a pedigree. Einion was questioned
about it, but without giving any satisfactory answer, and one came to
the conclusion that she was one of the fair family (<i lang=
"cy">Tylwyth Teg</i>). &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied Einion,
&ldquo;there can be no doubt that she comes from a very fair family;
for she has two sisters who are as fair as she, and, if you saw them
together, you would admit that name to be a most fitting one.&rdquo;
This, then, is the reason why the remarkable family in the Land of
Enchantment and Glamour (<i lang="cy">Hud a &#7930;edrith</i>) is
called the fair family.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The two next tales of Glasynys&rsquo; appear in <i lang="cy">Cymru
Fu</i>, at pp. 478&ndash;9; the first of them is to be compared with
one already related (pp. 99, 100), while the other is unlike anything
that I can now recall:&mdash;</p>
<p>(5) &lsquo;Cwm&#7931;an was the principal resort of the fair family,
and the shepherds of Hafod &#7930;an used to see them daily in the ages
of faith gone by. Once, on a misty afternoon, one of them had been
searching for sheep towards Nant y Bettws. When he had crossed Bwlch
Cwm&#7931;an, and was hastening laboriously down, he saw an endless
number of little folks singing and dancing in a lively and light-footed
fashion, while the handsomest girls he had ever seen anywhere were at
it preparing a banquet. He went to them and had a share of their
dainties, and it seemed to him that he had never in his life tasted
anything approaching their dishes. When the twilight came, they spread
their tents, and the man never before saw such beauty and ingenuity.
They gave him a soft bed of yielding down, with sheets of the finest
linen, and he went to rest as proud as if he had <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb116" href="#v1pb116" name=
"v1pb116">116</a>]</span>been a prince. But, alas! next morning, after
all the jollity and sham splendour, the poor man, when he opened his
eyes, found that his bed was but a bush of bulrushes, and his pillow a
clump of moss. Nevertheless, he found silver money in his shoes, and
afterwards he continued for a long time to find, every week, a piece of
coined money between two stones near the spot where he had slept. One
day, however, he told a friend of his the secret respecting the money,
and he never found any more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>(6) &lsquo;Another of these shepherds was one day urging his dog at
the sheep in Cwm&#7931;an, when he heard a kind of low noise in the
cleft of a rock. He turned to look, when he found there some kind of a
creature weeping plenteously. He approached, and drew out a wee lass;
very shortly afterwards two middle-aged men came to him to thank him
for his kindness, and, when about to part, one of them gave him a
walking-stick, as a souvenir of his good deed. The year after this,
every sheep in his possession had two ewe-lambs; and so his sheep
continued to breed for some years. But he had stayed one evening in the
village until it was rather late, and there hardly ever was a more
tempestuous night than that: the wind howled, and the clouds shed their
contents in sheets of rain, while the darkness was such that next to
nothing could be seen. As he was crossing the river that comes down
from Cwm&#7931;an, where its flood was sweeping all before it in a
terrible current, he somehow let go the walking-stick from his hand;
and when one went next morning up the Cwm, it was found that nearly all
the sheep had been swept away by the flood, and that the farmer&rsquo;s
wealth had gone almost as it came&mdash;with the
walking-stick.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The shorter versions given by Glasynys are probably more nearly
given as he heard them, than the longer <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb117" href="#v1pb117" name="v1pb117">117</a>]</span>ones, which may
be suspected of having been a good deal spun out by him; but there is
probably very little in any of them of his own invention, though the
question whence he got his materials in each instance may be difficult
to answer. In one this is quite clear, though he does not state it,
namely the story of the sojourn of Elfod the Shepherd in Fairyland, as
given in <i lang="cy">Cymru Fu</i>, p. 477: it is no other than a
second or third-hand reproduction of that recorded by Giraldus
concerning a certain Eliodorus, a twelfth-century cleric in the diocese
of St. David&rsquo;s<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4786src" href=
"#xd26e4786" name="xd26e4786src">9</a>. But the longest tale published
by Glasynys is the one about a mermaid: see <i lang="cy">Cymru Fu</i>,
pp. 434&ndash;44. Where he got this from I have not been able to find
out, but it has probably been pieced together from various sources. I
feel sure that some of the materials at least were Welsh, besides the
characters known to Welsh mythology as Nefy&#273; Naf Neifion, Gwyn ab
Nu&#273;, Gwydion ab D&ocirc;n, Dylan, and Ceridwen, who have been
recklessly introduced into it. He locates it, apparently, somewhere on
the coast of Carnarvonshire, the chief scene being called <i lang=
"cy">Ogof Deio</i> or David&rsquo;s Cave, which so far as I know is not
an actual name, but one suggested by &lsquo;David Jones&rsquo;
locker&rsquo; as sailors&rsquo; slang for the sea. In hopes that
somebody will communicate to me any bits of this tale that happen to be
still current on the Welsh coast, I give an abstract of it
here:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Once upon a time, a poor fisherman made the acquaintance of a
mermaid in a cave on the sea-coast; at first she screeched wildly, but,
when she got a little calmer, she told him to go off out of the way of
her brother, and to return betimes the day after. In getting away, he
was tossed into the sea, and tossed out on the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb118" href="#v1pb118" name=
"v1pb118">118</a>]</span>land with a rope, which had got wound about
his waist; and on pulling at this he got ashore a coffer full of
treasure, which he spent the night in carrying home. He was somewhat
late in revisiting the cave the next day, and saw no mermaid come there
to meet him according to her promise. But the following night he was
roused out of his sleep by a visit from her at his home, when she told
him to come in time next day. On his way thither, he learnt from some
fishermen that they had been labouring in vain during the night, as a
great big mermaid had opened their nets in order to pick the best fish,
while she let the rest escape. When he reached the cave he found the
mermaid there combing her hair: she surprised him by telling him that
she had come to live among the inhabitants of the land, though she was,
according to her own account, a king&rsquo;s daughter. She was no
longer stark naked, but dressed like a lady: in one hand she held a
diadem of pure gold, and in the other a cap of wonderful workmanship,
the former of which she placed on her head, while she handed the latter
to Ifan Morgan, with the order that he should keep it. Then she related
to him how she had noticed him when he was a ruddy boy, out fishing in
his father&rsquo;s white boat, and heard him sing a song which made her
love him, and how she had tried to repeat this song at her
father&rsquo;s court, where everybody wanted to get it. Many a time,
she said, she had been anxiously listening if she might hear it again,
but all in vain. So she had obtained permission from her family to come
with her treasures and see if he would not teach it her; but she soon
saw that she would not succeed without appearing in the form in which
she now was. After saying that her name was Nefyn, daughter of
Nefy&#273; Naf Neifion, and niece to Gwyn son of Nu&#273;, and Gwydion
son of D&ocirc;n, she calmed his feelings on <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb119" href="#v1pb119" name=
"v1pb119">119</a>]</span>the subject of the humble cottage in which he
lived. Presently he asked her to be his wife, and she consented on the
condition that he should always keep the cap she had given him out of
her sight and teach her the song. They were married and lived happily
together, and had children born them five times, a son and a daughter
each time; they frequently went to the cave, and no one knew what
treasures they had there; but once on a time they went out in a boat
pleasuring, as was their wont, with six or seven of the children
accompanying them, and when they were far from the land a great storm
arose; besides the usual accompaniments of a storm at sea, most
unearthly screeches and noises were heard, which frightened the
children and made their mother look uncomfortable; but presently she
bent her head over the side of the boat, and whispered something they
did not catch: to their surprise the sea was instantly calm. They got
home comfortably, but the elder children were puzzled greatly by their
mother&rsquo;s influence over the sea, and it was not long after this
till they so teased some ill-natured old women, that the latter told
them all about the uncanny origin of their mother. The eldest boy was
vexed at this, and remembered how his mother had spoken to somebody
near the boat at sea, and that he was never allowed to go with his
parents to Ogof Deio. He recalled, also, his mother&rsquo;s account of
the strange countries she had seen. Once there came also to Ifan
Morgan&rsquo;s home, which was now a mansion, a visitor whom the
children were not even allowed to see; and one night, when the young
moon had sunk behind the western horizon, Ifan and his wife went
quietly out of the house, telling a servant that they would not return
for three weeks or a month: this was overheard by the eldest son. So he
followed them very quietly until he saw them on the strand, where he
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb120" href="#v1pb120" name=
"v1pb120">120</a>]</span>beheld his mother casting a sort of leather
mantle round herself and his father, and both of them threw themselves
into the hollow of a billow that came to fetch them. The son went home,
broke his heart, and died in nine days at finding out that his mother
was a mermaid; and, on seeing her brother dead, his twin sister went
and threw herself into the sea; but, instead of being drowned, she was
taken up on his steed by a fine looking knight, who then galloped away
over the waves as if they had been dry and level land. The servants
were in doubt what to do, now that Nefy&#273; Morgan was dead and
Eilonwy had thrown herself into the sea; but Tegid, the second son, who
feared nothing, said that Nefy&#273;&rsquo;s body should be taken to
the strand, as somebody was likely to come to fetch it for burial among
his mother&rsquo;s family. At midnight a knight arrived, who said the
funeral was to be at three that morning, and told them that their
brother would come back to them, as Gwydion ab D&ocirc;n was going to
give him a heart that no weight could break, that Eilonwy was soon to
be wedded to one of the finest and bravest of the knights of
Gwer&#273;onau &#7930;ion, and that their parents were with Gwyn ab
Nu&#273; in the Gwaelodion. The body was accordingly taken to the
beach, and, as soon as the wave touched it, out of his coffin leaped
Nefy&#273; like a porpoise. He was seen then to walk away arm in arm
with Gwydion ab D&ocirc;n to a ship that was in waiting, and most
enchanting music was heard by those on shore; but soon the ship sailed
away, hardly touching the tops of the billows. After a year and a day
had elapsed Ifan Morgan, the father, came home, looking much better and
more gentlemanly than he had ever done before; he had never spoken of
Nefyn, his wife, until Tegid one day asked him what about his mother;
she had gone, he said, in search of Eilonwy, who had run away from her
husband in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb121" href="#v1pb121" name=
"v1pb121">121</a>]</span>Gwer&#273;onau &#7930;ion, with Glanfryd ab
Gloywfraint. She would be back soon, he thought, and describe to them
all the wonders they had seen. Ifan Morgan went to bed that night, and
was found dead in it in the morning; it was thought that his death had
been caused by a Black Knight, who had been seen haunting the place at
midnight for some time, and always disappearing, when pursued, into a
well that bubbled forth in a dark recess near at hand. The day of Ifan
Morgan&rsquo;s funeral, Nefyn, his wife, returned, and bewailed him
with many tears; she was never more seen on the dry land. Tegid had now
the charge of the family, and he conducted himself in all things as
behoved a man and a gentleman of high principles and great generosity.
He was very wealthy, but often grieved by the thought of his
father&rsquo;s murder. One day, when he and two of his brothers were
out in a boat fishing in the neighbouring bay, they were driven by the
wind to the most wonderful spot they had ever seen. The sea there was
as smooth as glass, and as bright as the clearest light, while beneath
it, and not far from them, they saw a most splendid country with
fertile fields and dales covered with pastures, with flowery hedges,
groves clad in their green foliage, and forests gently waving their
leafy luxuriance, with rivers lazily contemplating their own tortuous
courses, and with mansions here and there of the most beautiful and
ingenious description; and presently they saw that the inhabitants
amused themselves with all kinds of merriment and frolicking, and that
here and there they had music and engaged themselves in the most
energetic dancing; in fact, the rippling waves seemed to have absorbed
their fill of the music, so that the faint echo of it, as gently given
forth by the waves, never ceased to charm their ears until they reached
the shore. That night the three brothers <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb122" href="#v1pb122" name="v1pb122">122</a>]</span>had the same
dream, namely that the Black Knight who had throttled their father was
in hiding in a cave on the coast: so they made for the cave in the
morning, but the Black Knight fled from them and galloped off on the
waves as if he had been riding for amusement over a meadow. That day
their sisters, on returning home from school, had to cross a piece of
sea, when a tempest arose and sunk the vessel, drowning all on board,
and the brothers ascribed this to the Black Knight. About this time
there was great consternation among the fishermen on account of a
sea-serpent that twined itself about the rocks near the caves, and
nothing would do but that Tegid and his brothers should go forth to
kill it; but when one day they came near the spot frequented by it,
they heard a deep voice saying to them, &ldquo;Do not kill your
sister,&rdquo; so they wondered greatly and suddenly went home. But
that night Tegid returned there alone, and called his sister by her
name, and after waiting a long while she crept towards him in the shape
of a sea-serpent, and said that she must remain some time in that form
on account of her having run away with one who was not her husband; she
went on to say that she had seen their sisters walking with their
mother, and their father would soon be in the cave. But all of a sudden
there came the Black Knight, who unsheathed a sword that looked like a
flame of fire, and began to cut the sea-serpent into a thousand bits,
which united, however, as fast as he cut it, and became as whole as
before. The end was that the monster twisted itself in a coil round his
throat and bit him terribly in his breast. At this point a White Knight
comes and runs him through with his spear, so that he fell instantly,
while the White Knight went off hurriedly with the sea-serpent in a
coil round his neck. Tegid ran away for his life, but not before a
monster more terrible than <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb123" href=
"#v1pb123" name="v1pb123">123</a>]</span>anything he had ever seen had
begun to attack him. It haunted him in all kinds of ways: sometimes it
would be like a sea, but Tegid was able to swim: sometimes it would be
a mountain of ice, but Tegid was able to climb it: and sometimes it was
like a furnace of intense fire, but the heat had no effect on him. But
it appeared mostly as a combination of the beast of prey and the
venomous reptile. Suddenly, however, a young man appeared, taking hold
of Tegid&rsquo;s arm and encouraging him, when the monster fled away
screeching, and a host of knights in splendid array and on proudly
prancing horses came to him: among them he found his brothers, and he
went with them to his mother&rsquo;s country. He was especially welcome
there, and he found all happy and present save his father only, whom he
thought of fetching from the world above, having in fact got leave to
do so from his grandfather. His mother and his brothers went with him
to search for his father&rsquo;s body, and with him came Gwydion ab
D&ocirc;n and Gwyn ab Nu&#273;, but he would not be wakened. So Tegid,
who loved his father greatly, asked leave to remain on his
father&rsquo;s grave, where he remains to this day. His mother is wont
to come there to soothe him, and his brothers send him gifts, while he
sends his gifts to Nefy&#273; Naf Neifion, his grandfather; it is also
said that his twin-sister, Ceridwen, has long since come to live near
him, to make the glad gladder and the pretty prettier, and to maintain
her dignity and honour in peace and tranquillity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The latter part of this tale, the mention of Ceridwen, invoked by
the bards as the genius presiding over their profession, and of Tegid
remaining on his father&rsquo;s grave, is evidently a reference to
<i lang="cy">&#7930;yn Tegid</i>, or Bala Lake, and to the legend of
Taliessin in the so-called <i lang="cy">Hanes</i> or history of
Taliessin, published at the end of the third volume of Lady Charlotte
Guest&rsquo;s <i>Mabinogion</i>. So the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb124" href="#v1pb124" name="v1pb124">124</a>]</span>story has
undoubtedly been pieced together, but not all invented, as is proved by
the reference to the curious cap which the husband was to keep out of
the sight of his mermaid wife. In Irish legends this cap has particular
importance attached to it, of which Glasynys cannot have been aware,
for he knew of no use to make of it. The teaching of the song to the
wife is not mentioned after the marriage; and the introduction of it at
all is remarkable: at any rate I have never noticed anything parallel
to it in other tales. The incident of the tempest, when the mermaid
spoke to somebody by the side of the boat, reminds one of Undine during
the trip on the Danube. It is, perhaps, useless to go into details till
one has ascertained how much of the story has been based on genuine
Welsh folklore. But, while I am on this point, I venture to append here
an Irish tale, which will serve to explain the meaning of the
mermaid&rsquo;s cap, as necessary to her comfort in the water world. I
am indebted for it to the kindness of Dr. Norman Moore, of St.
Bartholomew&rsquo;s Hospital, who tells me, in a letter dated March 7,
1882, that he and the Miss Raynells of Killynon heard it from an old
woman named Mrs. Dolan, who lived on the property of the late Mr. Cooke
of Cookesborough, in Westmeath. The following was her
tale:&mdash;&lsquo;There was a man named Mahon had a farm on the edge
of Loch Owel. He noticed that his corn was trampled, and he sat up all
night to watch it. He saw horses, colts and fillies rather, come up out
of the lake and trample it. He chased them, and they fled into the
lake. The next night he saw them again, and among them a beautiful girl
with a cap of salmon skin on her head, and it shone in the moonlight;
and he caught her and embraced her, and carried her off to his house
and married her, and she was a very good housewife, as all those lake
people are, and kept his house <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb125"
href="#v1pb125" name="v1pb125">125</a>]</span>beautifully; and one day
in the harvest, when the men were in the fields, she went into the
house, and there she looked on the hurdle for some lard to make
colcannon<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4830src" href="#xd26e4830" name=
"xd26e4830src">10</a> for the men, and she saw her old cap of fish
skin, and she put it on her head and ran straight down into the lake
and was never seen any more, and Mahon he was terribly grieved, and he
died soon after of a decline. She had had three children, and I often
saw them in the Mullingar market. They were farmers, too, on Loch
Owel.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="first">Let me now return to the fresh-water fairies of
Snowdon and give a reference to Pennant&rsquo;s <i>Tours in Wales</i>:
in the edition published at Carnarvon in 1883 we are told, ii. 326, how
Mr. Pennant learned &lsquo;that, in fairy days, those diminutive gentry
kept their revels&rsquo; on the margins of the Snowdon lake, called
&#7930;yn Coch. There is no legend now extant, so far as I can
ascertain, about the &#7930;yn Coch fairies. So I proceed to append a
legend differing considerably from all the foregoing: I owe it to the
kindness of my friend Mr. Howell Thomas, of the Local Government Board.
It was written out by Mr. G. B. Gattie, and I take the liberty of
prefixing to it his letter to Mr. Thomas, dated Walham Grove, London,
S.W., April 27, 1882. The letter runs as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had quite forgotten the enclosed, which I had jotted down
during my recent illness, and ought to have sent you long ago. Of
course, the wording is very rough, as no care has been taken on that
point. It is interesting, as being another version of a very pretty old
legend which my mother used to repeat. She was descended from a very
old north Welsh family; indeed, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb126"
href="#v1pb126" name="v1pb126">126</a>]</span>I believe my esteemed
grandfather went so far as to trace his descent from the great patriot,
Owen Glendower himself! My mother delighted not only in the ancient
folklore legends and fairy tales of the Principality, with which she
was perfectly familiar, but especially in the lovely national melodies,
all of which she knew by heart; and, being highly accomplished, would
never tire of playing or singing them. You will see the legend is, in
the main, much as related by Professor Rhys, though differing somewhat
in the singular terms of the marriage contract. The scene of the
legend, as related by my late mother, was, of course, a lake, the Welsh
name of which I have, unfortunately, forgotten, but it was somewhere, I
think, near &#7930;anberis, and the hero a stalwart young
farmer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The legend itself reads as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;One hot day, the farmer, riding by the lake, took his horse
into the water to drink, and, whilst looking straight down over his
horse&rsquo;s ears into the smooth surface, he became aware of a most
lovely face, just beneath the tide, looking up archly at him. Quite
bewildered, he earnestly beckoned, and by degrees the head and
shoulders which belonged to the face emerged from the water. Overcome
with emotion, and nearly maddened by the blaze of beauty so suddenly
put before him, he leaped from his horse and rushed wildly into the
lake to try to clasp the lovely vision to his heart. As this was a
clear case of &ldquo;love at first sight,&rdquo; the poor young man was
not, of course, answerable for his actions. But the vision had vanished
beneath the waves, to instantly reappear, however, a yard or two off,
with the most provoking of smiles, and holding out her beautiful white
hands towards her admirer, but slipping off into deep water the moment
he approached.</p>
<p>&lsquo;For many days the young farmer frequented the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb127" href="#v1pb127" name=
"v1pb127">127</a>]</span>lake, but without again seeing the beautiful
Naiad, until one day he sat down by the margin hoping that she would
appear, and yet dreading her appearance, for this latter to him simply
meant loss of all peace. Yet he rushed on his fate, like the love-sick
shepherd in the old Italian romance, who watched the sleeping beauty,
yet dreaded her awakening:&mdash;<i lang="it">Io perder&ograve; la
pace, quando si sveglier&agrave;!</i></p>
<p>&lsquo;The young man had brought the remains of his frugal dinner
with him, and was quietly munching, by way of dessert, an apple of rare
and delicious quality, from a tree which grew upon a neighbouring
estate. Suddenly the lady appeared in all her rare beauty almost close
to him, and begged him to &ldquo;throw&rdquo; her one of his apples.
This was altogether too much, and he replied by holding out the
tempting morsel, exhibiting its beautiful red and green sides, saying
that, if she really wanted it, she must fetch it herself. Upon this she
came up quite close, and, as she took the apple from his left hand, he
dexterously seized tight hold of her with his right, and held her fast.
She, however, nothing daunted, bawled lustily, at the top of her voice,
for help, and made such an outrageous noise, that at length a most
respectable looking old gentleman appeared suddenly out of the midst of
the lake. He had a superb white beard, and was simply and classically
attired merely in a single wreath of beautiful water-lilies wound round
his loins, which was possibly his summer costume, the weather being
hot. He politely requested to know what was the matter, and what the
young farmer wanted with his daughter. The case was thereupon
explained, but not without the usual amount of nervous trepidation
which usually happens to love-sick swains when called into the awful
presence of &ldquo;Papa&rdquo; to &ldquo;explain their
intentions!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;After a long parley the lady, at length, agreed to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb128" href="#v1pb128" name=
"v1pb128">128</a>]</span>become the young man&rsquo;s wife on two
conditions, which he was to solemnly promise to keep. These conditions
were that he was never to strike her with <i>steel</i> or <i>clay</i>
(earth), conditions to which the young man very readily assented. As
these were primitive days, when people were happy and honest, there
were no lawyers to encumber the Holy Estate with lengthy settlements,
and to fill their own pockets with heavy fees; matters were therefore
soon settled, and the lady married to the young farmer on the spot by
the very respectable old lake deity, her papa.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The story goes on to say that the union was followed by two
sons and two daughters. The eldest son became a great physician, and
all his descendants after him were celebrated for their great
proficiency in the noble healing art. The second son was a mighty
craftsman in all works appertaining to the manufacture and use of iron
and metals. Indeed it has been hinted that, his little corracle of
bull&rsquo;s hide having become old and unsafe, he conceived the
brilliant idea of making one of thin iron. This he actually
accomplished, and, to the intense amazement of the wondering populace,
he constantly used it for fishing, or other purposes, on the lake,
where he paddled about in perfect security. This important fact ought
to be more generally known, as it gives him a fair claim to the
introduction of iron ship-building, <i>pace</i> the shades of Beaufort
and Brunel.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of the two daughters, one is said to have invented the small
ten-stringed harp, and the other the spinning-wheel. Thus were
introduced the arts of medicine, manufactures, music, and woollen
work.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As the old ballad says, applying the quotation to the father
and mother:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">They lived for more than forty year</p>
<p class="line xd26e2450">Right long and happilie!</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb129" href="#v1pb129" name=
"v1pb129">129</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;One day it happened that the wife expressed a great wish for
some of those same delicious apples of which she was so fond, and of
which their neighbour often sent them a supply. Off went the farmer,
like a good husband that he was, and brought back, not only some
apples, but a beautiful young sapling, seven or eight feet high,
bearing the same apple, as a present from their friend. This they at
once proceeded to set, he digging and she holding; but the hole not
being quite deep enough he again set to work, with increased energy,
with his spade, and stooping very low threw out the last shovelful over
his shoulder&mdash;alas! without looking&mdash;full into the breast of
his wife. She dropped the sapling and solemnly warned him that one of
the two conditions of their marriage contract had been broken. Accident
was pleaded, but in vain; there was the unfortunate fact&mdash;<i>he
had struck her with clay</i>! Looking upon the sapling as the cause of
this great trouble he determined to return it forthwith to his kind
neighbour. Taking a bridle in his hand he proceeded to the field to
catch his horse, his wife kindly helping him. They both ran up, one on
each side, and, as the unruly steed showed no signs of stopping, the
husband attempted to throw the bridle over his head. Not having visited
Mexico in his travels, and thereby learned the use of the lasso, he
missed his horse&rsquo;s head and&mdash;misfortune of
misfortunes&mdash;struck his wife in the face with the iron bit, thus
breaking the second condition. <i>He had struck her with steel.</i> She
no sooner received the blow than&mdash;like Esau&mdash;she &ldquo;cried
with a great and exceeding bitter cry,&rdquo; and bidding her husband a
last farewell, fled down the hill with lightning speed, dashed into the
lake, and disappeared beneath the smooth and glassy waters! Thus, it
may be said that, if an apple&mdash;indirectly&mdash;occasioned the
beginning <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb130" href="#v1pb130" name=
"v1pb130">130</a>]</span>of her married life, so an apple brought about
its sad termination.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Such is Mr. Gattie&rsquo;s tale, and to him probably is to be traced
its literary trimming; but even when it is stripped of that accessory,
it leaves us with difficulties of somewhat the same order as those
attaching to some of the stories which have passed through the hands of
Glasynys. However, the substance of it seems to be genuine, and to
prove that there has been a Northwalian tradition which traced the
medical art to a lake lady like the Egeria of the Physicians of
My&#273;fai.</p>

<p class="first">Allusion has already been made to the <i lang=
"cy">afanc</i> story, and it is convenient to give it before proceeding
any further. The <i>Cambrian Journal</i> for 1859, pp. 142&ndash;6,
gives it in a letter of Edward &#7930;wyd&rsquo;s dated 1693, and
contributed to that periodical by the late Canon Robert Williams, of
Rhyd y Croesau, who copied it from the original letter in his
possession<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4907src" href="#xd26e4907" name=
"xd26e4907src">11</a>, and here follows a translation into English of
the part of it which concerns &#7930;yn yr Afanc<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4910src" href="#xd26e4910" name="xd26e4910src">12</a>, a pool on
the river Conwy, above Bettws y Coed and opposite Capel
Garmon:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose it very probable that you have heard speak of
&#7930;yn yr Afanc, &ldquo;the Afanc&rsquo;s Pool,&rdquo; and that I
therefore need not trouble to inform you where it stands. I think,
also, that you know, if one may trust what the country people say, that
it was a girl that enticed the afanc to come out of his abode, namely
the pool, so as to be bound with iron chains, whilst he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb131" href="#v1pb131" name=
"v1pb131">131</a>]</span>slumbered with his head on her knees, and with
the grip of one hand on her breast. When he woke from his nap and
perceived what had been done to him, he got up suddenly and hurried to
his old refuge, taking with him in his claw the breast of his
sweetheart. It was then seen that it was well the chain was long enough
to be fastened to oxen that pulled him out of the pool. Thereupon a
considerable dispute arose among some of the people, each asserting
that he had taken a great weight on himself and pulled far harder than
anybody else. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said another, &ldquo;it was I,&rdquo;
&amp;c. And whilst they were wrangling in this way, the report goes
that the afanc answered them, and silenced their discontent by
saying&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>Oni bae y dai ag a dyn</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>Ni &#273;actha&rsquo;r afanc byth o&rsquo;r

</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Had it not been for the oxen pulling,</p>
<p class="line">The afanc had never left the pool.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">&lsquo;You must understand that some take the afanc to
be a corporeal demon; but I am sufficiently satisfied that there is an
animal of the same name, which is called in English a <i>bever</i>,
seeing that the term <i lang="cy">cei&#7931;ie&rsquo;r afanc</i>
signifies <i>bever stones</i>. I know not what kind of oxen those in
question were, but it is related that they were twins; nor do I know
why they were called <i lang="cy">Ychain Mannog</i> or <i lang=
"cy">Ychain Bannog</i>. But peradventure they were called <i lang=
"cy">Ychain Bannog</i> in reference to their having had many a
fattening, or fattening on fattening (having been for many a year
fattened). Yet the word <i lang="cy">bannog</i> is not a good, suitable
word to signify fattened, as <i lang="cy">bannog</i> is nought else
than what has been made exceeding thick by beating [or fulling], as one
says of a thick blanket made of coarse yarn (<i lang="cy">y gwrthban
tew-bannog</i>), the thick <i lang="cy">bannog</i><a class="noteref"
id="xd26e4970src" href="#xd26e4970" name="xd26e4970src">13</a> blanket.
Whilst I was dawdling <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb132" href=
"#v1pb132" name="v1pb132">132</a>]</span>behind talking about this, the
oxen had proceeded very far, and I did not find their footmarks as they
came through portions of the parish of Doly&#273;-Elan (Lue&#273;og)
until I reached a pass called ever since <i lang="cy">Bwlch
Rhiw&rsquo;r Ychen</i>, &ldquo;the Pass of the Slope of the
Oxen,&rdquo; between the upper parts of Doly&#273;elan and the upper
part of Nanhwynen. In coming over this pass one of the oxen dropped one
of its eyes on an open spot, which for that reason is called <i lang=
"cy">Gwaun Lygad Ych</i>, &ldquo;the Moor of the Ox&rsquo;s Eye.&rdquo;
The place where the eye fell has become a pool, which is by this time
known as <i lang="cy">Pw&#7931; &#7930;ygad Ych</i>, &ldquo;the Pool of
the Ox&rsquo;s Eye,&rdquo; which is at no time dry, though no water
rises in it or flows into it except when rain falls; nor is there any
flowing out of it during dry weather. It is always of the same depth;
that is, it reaches about one&rsquo;s knee-joint, according to those
who have paid attention to that for a considerable number of years.
There is a harp melody, which not all musicians know: it is known as
the <i lang="cy">Ychain Mannog</i> air, and it has a piteous effect on
the ear, being as plaintive as were the groanings of these <i lang=
"cy">Ychain</i> under the weight of the afanc, especially when one of
the pair lost an eye. They pulled him up to &#7930;yn Cwm Ffynnon Las,
&ldquo;the Lake of the Dingle of the Green Well,&rdquo; to which he was
consigned, for the reason, peradventure, that some believed that there
were in that lake uncanny things already in store. In fact, it was but
fitting that he should be permitted to go to his kind. But whether
there were uncanny things in it before or not, many think that there is
nothing good in it now, as you will understand from what follows. There
is much talk of &#7930;yn Cwm Ffynnon Las besides the fact that it is
always free from ice, except in one corner where the peat water of
clear pools comes into it, and that it has also a variety of dismal
hues. The cause of this is, as I suppose, to be <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb133" href="#v1pb133" name=
"v1pb133">133</a>]</span>sought in the various hues of the rocks
surrounding it; and the fact that a whirlwind makes its water mixed,
which is enough to give any lake a disagreeable colour. Nothing swims
on it without danger, and I am not sure that it would be very safe for
a bird to fly across it or not. Throw a rag into its water and it will
go to the bottom, and I have with my own ears heard a man saying that
he saw a goat taking to this lake in order to avoid being caught, and
that as soon as the animal went into the water, it turned round and
round, as if it had been a top, until it was drowned&#8202;&hellip;.
Some mention that, as some great man was hunting in the Snowdon
district (Eryri), a stag, to avoid the hounds when they were pressing
on him, and as is the habit of stags to defend themselves, made his
escape into this lake: the hunters had hardly time to turn round before
they saw the stag&rsquo;s antlers (<i lang="cy">mwnglws</i>) coming to
the surface, but nothing more have they ever seen&#8202;&hellip;. A
young woman has been seen to come out of this lake to wash clothes, and
when she had done she folded the clothes, and taking them under her arm
went back into the lake. One man, whose brother is still alive and
well, beheld in a canoe, on this same lake still, an angler with a red
cap on his head; but the man died within a few days, having not been in
his right mind during that time. Most people regard this as the real
truth, and, as for myself, I cannot refuse to believe that such a
vision might not cause a man to become so bewildered as to force on a
disease ending with his death&#8202;&hellip;.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The name &#7930;yn Cwm Ffynnon Las would have led one to suppose
that the pool meant is the one given in the ordnance maps as &#7930;yn
y Cwm Ffynnon, and situated in the mountains between Pen y Gwryd and
the upper valley of &#7930;anberis; but from the writer on the parish
of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb134" href="#v1pb134" name=
"v1pb134">134</a>]</span>Be&#273;gelert in the <i lang="cy">Brython</i>
for 1861, pp. 371&ndash;2, it appears that this is not so, and that the
tarn meant was in the upper reach of Cwm Dyli, and was known as
&#7930;yn y Ffynnon Las, &lsquo;Lake of the Green Well,&rsquo; about
which he has a good deal to say in the same strain as that of
&#7930;wyd in the letter already cited. Among other things he remarks
that it is a very deep tarn, and that its bottom has been ascertained
to be lower than the surface of &#7930;yn &#7930;ydaw, which lies 300
feet lower. And as to the afanc, he remarks that the inhabitants of
Nant Conwy and the lower portions of the parish of Dolwy&#273;elan,
having frequent troubles and losses inflicted on them by a huge monster
in the river Conwy, near Bettws y Coed, tried to kill it but in vain,
as no harpoon, no arrow or spear made any impression whatsoever on the
brute&rsquo;s hide; so it was resolved to drag it away as in the
&#7930;wyd story. I learn from Mr. Pierce (Elis o&rsquo;r Nant), of
Dolwy&#273;elan, that the lake is variously known as &#7930;yn (Cwm)
Ffynnon Las, and &#7930;yn Glas or Glaslyn: this last is the form which
I find in the maps. It is to be noticed that the Nant Conwy people, by
dragging the afanc there, got him beyond their own watershed, so that
he could no more cause floods in the Conwy.</p>
<p>Here, as promised at p. 74, I append Lewis Glyn Cothi&rsquo;s words
as to the afanc in &#7930;yn Syfa&#273;on. The bard is dilating in the
poem, where they occur, on his affection for his friend &#7930;ywelyn
ab Gwilym ab Thomas Vaughan, of Bryn Hafod in the Vale of Towy, and
averring that it would be as hard to induce him to quit his
friend&rsquo;s hospitable home, as it was to get the afanc away from
the Lake of Syfa&#273;on, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="first">From this passage it would seem that the Syfa&#273;on
story contemplated the afanc being taken away from the lake in a cart
or waggon drawn by oxen; but whether driven by Hu, or by whom, one is
not told. However, the story must have represented the undertaking as a
failure, and the afanc as remaining in his lake: had it been otherwise
it would be hard to see the point of the comparison.</p>

<p class="first">The parish of &#7930;anfachreth and its traditions
have been the subject of some contributions to the first volume of the
<i lang="cy">Taliesin</i> published at Ruthin in 1859&ndash;60, pp.
132&ndash;7, by a writer who calls himself <i lang="cy">Cofiadur</i>.
It was Glasynys, I believe, for the style seems to be his: he pretends
to copy from an old manuscript of Hugh Bifan&rsquo;s&mdash;both the
manuscript and its owner were fictions of Glasynys&rsquo; as I am told.
These jottings contain two or three items about the fairies which seem
to be genuine:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The bottom of &#7930;yn Cynnwch, on the Nannau estate, is
level with the hearth-stone of the house of D&ocirc;l y Clochy&#273;.
Its depth was found out owing to the sweetheart of one of Siwsi&rsquo;s
girls having lost his way to her from Nannau, where he was a servant.
The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb136" href="#v1pb136" name=
"v1pb136">136</a>]</span>poor man had fallen into the lake, and gone
down and down, when he found it becoming clearer the lower he got,
until at last he alighted on a level spot where everybody and
everything looked much as he had observed on the dry land. When he had
reached the bottom of the lake, a short fat old gentleman came to him
and asked his business, when he told him how it happened that he had
come. He met with great welcome, and he stayed there a month without
knowing that he had been there three days, and when he was going to
leave, he was led out to his beloved by the inhabitants of the lake
bottom. He asserted that the whole way was level except in one place,
where they descended about a fathom into the ground; but, he added, it
was necessary to ascend about as much to reach the hearth-stone of
D&ocirc;l y Clochy&#273;. The most wonderful thing, however, was that
the stone lifted itself as he came up from the subterranean road
towards it. It was thus the sweetheart arrived there one evening, when
the girl was by the fire weeping for him. Siwsi had been out some days
before, and she knew all about it though she said nothing to anybody.
This, then, was the way in which the depth of &#7930;yn Cynnwch came to
be known.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then he has a few sentences about an old house called
Ceimarch:&mdash;&lsquo;Ceimarch was an old mansion of considerable
repute, and in old times it was considered next to Nannau in point of
importance in the whole district. There was a deep ditch round it,
which was always kept full of water, with the view of keeping off
vagabonds and thieves, as well as other lawless folks, that they might
not take the inmates by surprise. But, in distant ages, this place was
very noted for the frequent visits paid it by the fair family. They
used to come to the ditch to wash themselves, and to cross the water
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb137" href="#v1pb137" name=
"v1pb137">137</a>]</span>in boats made of the bark of the
rowan-tree<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5075src" href="#xd26e5075" name=
"xd26e5075src">15</a>, or else birch, and they came into the house to
pay their rent for trampling the ground around the place. They always
placed a piece of money under a pitcher, and the result was that the
family living there became remarkably rich. But somehow, after the
lapse of many years, the owner of the place offended them, by showing
disrespect for their diminutive family: soon the world began to go
against him, and it was not long before he got low in life. Everything
turned against him, and in times past everybody believed that he
incurred all this because he had earned the displeasure of the fair
family.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the <i lang="cy">Brython</i> for the year 1862, p. 456, in the
course of an essay on the history of the Lordship of Maw&#273;wy in
Merioneth, considered the best in a competition at an Eiste&#273;fod
held at Dinas Maw&#273;wy, August 2, 1855, Glasynys gives the following
bit about the fairies of that neighbourhood:&mdash;&lsquo;The side of
Aran Faw&#273;wy is a great place for the fair family: they are ever at
it playing their games on the hillsides about this spot. It is said
that they are numberless likewise about Bwlch y Groes. Once a boy
crossed over near the approach of night, one summer eve, from the Gadfa
to Maw&#273;wy, and on his return he saw near Aber Rhiwlech a swarm of
the little family dancing away full pelt. The boy began to run, with
two of the maidens in pursuit of him, entreating him to stay; but
Robin, for that was his name, kept running, and the two elves failed
altogether to catch him, otherwise he would have been taken a prisoner
of love. There are plenty of their dancing-rings to be seen on the
hillsides between Aber Rhiwlech and Bwlch y Groes.&rsquo; <span class=

<p>Here I would introduce two other Merionethshire tales, which I have
received from Mr. E. S. Roberts, master of the &#7930;andysilio School,
near &#7930;ango&#7931;en. He has learnt them from one Abel Evans, who
lives at present in the parish of &#7930;andysilio: he is a native of
the parish of &#7930;andri&#7931;o on the slopes of the Berwyn, and of
a glen in the same, known as Cwm Pennant, so called from its being
drained by the Pennant on its way to join the Dee. Now Cwm Pennant was
the resort of fairies, or of a certain family of them, and the
occurrence, related in the following tale, must have taken place no
less than seventy years ago: it was well known to the late Mrs. Ellen
Edwards of &#7930;andri&#7931;o:&mdash;</p>
<p lang="cy"><i>Ryw &#273;iwrnod aeth dau gyfai&#7931; i hela dwfrgwn

<p>&lsquo;One day, two friends went to hunt otters on the banks of the
Pennant, and when they were directing their steps towards the river,
they beheld some small creature of a red colour running fast across the
meadows in the direction of the river. Off they ran after it, and saw
that it went beneath the roots of a tree on the brink of the river to
hide itself. The two men thought it was an otter, but, at the same
time, they could not understand why it seemed to them to be of a red
colour. They wished to take it alive, and off one of them went to a
farm house that was not far away to ask for a sack, which he got, to
put the creature into it. Now there were two holes under the roots of
the tree, and while one held the sack with its mouth open over one of
them, the other pushed his stick into the other hole, and presently the
creature went into the sack. The two men thought they had caught an
otter, which they looked upon as no small feat. They set out for home,
but before they had proceeded the width of one field, the inmate of the
sack spoke to them in a sad voice, and said, &ldquo;My mother is
calling for me; oh, my mother is calling for me!&rdquo; This gave the
two hunters a great fright, so that they at once threw down the sack;
and great was their surprise to see a little man in a red dress running
out of the sack towards the river. He disappeared from their sight in
the bushes by the river. The two men were greatly terrified, and felt
that it was more prudent to go home than meddle any further with the
fair family.&rsquo; So far as I know, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb140" href="#v1pb140" name="v1pb140">140</a>]</span>this story
stands alone in Welsh folklore; but it has an exact parallel in
Lancashire<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5096src" href="#xd26e5096" name=
"xd26e5096src">16</a>.</p>
<p>The other story, which I now reproduce, was obtained by Mr. Roberts
from the same Abel Evans. He learnt it from Mrs. Ellen Edwards, and it
refers to a point in her lifetime, which Abel Evans fixes at ninety
years ago. Mr. Roberts has not succeeded in recovering the name of the
cottager of whom it speaks; but he lived on the side of the Berwyn,
above Cwm Pennant, where till lately a cottage used to stand, near
which the fairies had one of their resorts:&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;The occupier of the cottage had tilled a small portion of the
mountain side near his home in order to plant potatoes, which he did.
He observed that there was a rook&rsquo;s nest on a tree which was not
far from this spot, and it struck him that it would be prudent to break
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb141" href="#v1pb141" name=
"v1pb141">141</a>]</span>the nest before the rooks multiplied. So he
climbed the tree and broke the nest, and, after coming down, he noticed
a green circle (a fairy ring) round the tree, and on this circle he
espied, to his great joy, half a crown. As he went by the same spot the
following morning, he found another half a crown in the same place as
before. So it happened for several days; but one day he told a friend
of his good luck, and showed him the spot where he found half a crown
every morning. Now the next morning there was for him neither half a
crown nor anything else, because he had broken the rule of the fair
folks by making their liberality known, they being of opinion that the
left hand should not know what the right hand does.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So runs this short tale, which the old lady, Mrs. Edwards, and the
people of the neighbourhood explained as an instance of the gratitude
of the fairies to a man who had rendered them a service, which in this
case was supposed to have consisted in ridding them of the rooks, that
disturbed their merry-makings in the green ring beneath the branches of
the tree.</p>

<p class="first">It would be unpardonable to pass away from Merioneth
without alluding to the stray cow of &#7930;yn Barfog. The story
appears in Welsh in the <i lang="cy">Brython</i> for 1860, pp.
183&ndash;4, but the contributor, who closely imitates Glasynys&rsquo;
style, says that he got his materials from a paper by the late Mr.
Pughe of Aberdovey, by which he seems to have meant an article
contributed by the latter to the <i lang="la">Arch&aelig;ologia
Cambrensis</i>, and published in the volume for 1853, pp. 201&ndash;5.
Mr. Pughe dwells in that article a good deal on the scenery of the
corner of Merioneth in the rear of Aberdovey; but the chief thing in
his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb142" href="#v1pb142" name=
"v1pb142">142</a>]</span>paper is the legend connected with &#7930;yn
Barfog, which he renders into English as the Bearded Lake<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e5131src" href="#xd26e5131" name=
"xd26e5131src">17</a>. It is described as a mountain lake in a secluded
spot in the upland country behind Aberdovey; but I shall let Mr. Pughe
speak for himself:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The lovers of Cambrian lore are aware that the <i>Triads</i>
in their record of the deluge affirm that it was occasioned by a mystic
Afanc y &#7930;yn, crocodile<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5145src" href=
"#xd26e5145" name="xd26e5145src">18</a> of the lake, breaking the banks
of &#7930;yn &#7930;ion, the lake of waters; and the recurrence of that
catastrophe was prevented only by Hu Gadarn, the bold man of power,
dragging away the afanc by aid of his <i lang="cy">Ychain Banawg</i>,
or large horned oxen. Many a lakelet in our land has put forward its
claim to the location of &#7930;yn &#7930;ion; amongst the rest, this
lake. Be that as it may, King Arthur and his war-horse have the credit
amongst the mountaineers here of ridding them of the monster, in place
of Hu the Mighty, in proof of which is shown an impression on a
neighbouring rock bearing a resemblance to those made by the shoe or
hoof of a horse, as having been left there by his charger when our
British Hercules was engaged in this redoubtable act of prowess, and
this impression has been given the name of Carn March Arthur, the hoof
of Arthur&rsquo;s horse, which it retains to this day. It is believed
to be very perilous to let the waters out of the lake, and recently an
aged inhabitant of the district informed the writer that she
recollected this being done during a period of long <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb143" href="#v1pb143" name=
"v1pb143">143</a>]</span>drought, in order to procure motive power for
&#7930;yn Pair Mill, and that long-continued heavy rains followed. No
wonder our bold but superstitious progenitors, awe-struck by the
solitude of the spot&mdash;the dark sepial tint of its waters,
unrelieved by the flitting apparition of a single fish, and seldom
visited by the tenants of the air&mdash;should have established it as a
canon in their creed of terror that the lake formed one of the many
communications between this outward world of ours and the inner or
lower one of Annwn&mdash;the unknown world<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5165src" href="#xd26e5165" name="xd26e5165src">19</a>&mdash;the
dominion of Gwyn ap Nu&#273;, the mythic king of the fabled realm,
peopled by those children of mystery, Plant Annwn; and the belief is
still current amongst the inhabitants of our mountains in the
occasional visitations of the Gwrage&#273; Annwn, or dames of Elfin
land, to this upper world of ours. A shrewd old hill farmer (Thomas
Abergraes by name), well skilled in the folk-lore of the district,
informed me that, in years gone by, though when, exactly, he was too
young to remember, those dames were wont to make their appearance,
arrayed in green, in the neighbourhood of &#7930;yn Barfog, chiefly at
eventide, accompanied by their kine and hounds, and that on quiet
summer nights in particular, these ban-hounds were often to be heard in
full cry pursuing their prey&mdash;the souls of doomed men dying
without baptism and penance&mdash;along the upland township of
Cefnrhosucha. Many a farmer had a sight of their comely milk-white
kine; many a swain had his soul turned to romance and poesy by a sudden
vision of themselves in the guise of damsels arrayed in green, and
radiant in beauty and grace; and many a sportsman had his path crossed
by their white hounds of supernatural <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb144" href="#v1pb144" name="v1pb144">144</a>]</span>fleetness and
comeliness, the Cwn Annwn; but never had any one been favoured with
more than a passing view of either, till an old farmer residing at
Dyssyrnant, in the adjoining valley of Dyffryn Gwyn, became at last the
lucky captor of one of their milk-white kine. The acquaintance which
the Gwartheg y &#7930;yn, the kine of the lake, had formed with the
farmer&rsquo;s cattle, like the loves of the angels for the daughters
of men, became the means of capture; and the farmer was thereby enabled
to add the mystic cow to his own herd, an event in all cases believed
to be most conducive to the worldly prosperity of him who should make
so fortunate an acquisition. Never was there such a cow, never such
calves, never such milk and butter, or cheese, and the fame of the
Fuwch Gyfeiliorn, the stray cow, was soon spread abroad through that
central part of Wales known as the district of Rhwng y &#273;wy Afon,
from the banks of the Maw&#273;ach to those of the Dofwy<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e5171src" href="#xd26e5171" name=
"xd26e5171src">20</a>&mdash;from Aberdiswnwy<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5174src" href="#xd26e5174" name="xd26e5174src">21</a> to
Abercorris. The farmer, from a small beginning, rapidly became, like
Job, a man of substance, possessed of thriving herds of cattle&mdash;a
very patriarch among the mountains. But, alas! wanting Job&rsquo;s
restraining grace, his wealth made him proud, his pride made him forget
his obligation to the Elfin cow, and fearing she might soon become too
old to be profitable, he fattened her for the butcher, and then even
she did not fail to distinguish herself, for a more monstrously fat
beast was never seen. At last the day of slaughter came&mdash;an
eventful day in the annals of a mountain farm&mdash;the killing of a
fat cow, and such a monster of obesity! No wonder all the neighbours
were gathered together <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb145" href=
"#v1pb145" name="v1pb145">145</a>]</span>to see the sight. The old
farmer looked upon the preparations in self-pleased
importance&mdash;the butcher felt he was about no common feat of his
craft, and, baring his arms, he struck the blow&mdash;not now fatal,
for before even a hair had been injured, his arm was
paralysed&mdash;the knife dropped from his hand, and the whole company
was electrified by a piercing cry that awakened echo in a dozen hills,
and made the welkin ring again; and lo and behold! the whole assemblage
saw a female figure clad in green, with uplifted arms, standing on one
of the craigs overhanging &#7930;yn Barfog, and heard her calling with
a voice loud as thunder:&mdash;</p>

<p class="first">And no sooner were these words of power uttered than
the original lake cow and all her progeny, to the third and fourth
generations, were in full flight towards the heights of &#7930;yn
Barfog, as if pursued by the evil one. Self-interest quickly roused the
farmer, who followed in pursuit, till breathless and panting he gained
an eminence overlooking the lake, but with no better success than to
behold the green attired dame leisurely descending mid-lake,
accompanied by the fugitive cows and their calves formed in a circle
around her, they tossing their tails, she waving her hands in scorn as
much as to say, &ldquo;You may catch us, my friend, if you can,&rdquo;
as they disappeared beneath the dark waters of the lake, leaving only
the yellow water-lily to mark the spot where they <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb146" href="#v1pb146" name=
"v1pb146">146</a>]</span>vanished, and to perpetuate the memory of this
strange event. Meanwhile the farmer looked with rueful countenance upon
the spot where the Elfin herd disappeared, and had ample leisure to
deplore the effects of his greediness, as with them also departed the
prosperity which had hitherto attended him, and he became impoverished
to a degree below his original circumstances; and, in his altered
circumstances, few felt pity for one who in the noontide flow of
prosperity had shown himself so far forgetful of favours received, as
to purpose slaying his benefactor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Pughe did a very good thing in saving this legend from oblivion,
but it would be very interesting to know how much of it is still
current among the inhabitants of the retired district around &#7930;yn
Barfog, and how the story would look when stripped of the florid
language in which Mr. Pughe thought proper to clothe it. Lastly, let me
add a reference to the <i>Iolo Manuscripts</i>, pp. 85, 475, where a
short story is given concerning a certain Milkwhite Sweet-milk Cow
(<i lang="cy">y Fuwch Laethwen Lefrith</i>) whose milk was so abundant
and possessed of such virtues as almost to rival the Holy Grail. Like
the Holy Grail also this cow wandered everywhere spreading plenty,
until she chanced to come to the Vale of Towy, where the foolish
inhabitants wished to kill and eat her: the result was that she
vanished in their hands and has never since been heard of.</p>

<p class="first">Here I wish to add some further stories connected with
Merionethshire which have come under my notice lately. I give them
chiefly on the authority of Mr. Owen M. Edwards of Lincoln College, who
is a native of &#7930;anuwch&#7931;yn, and still spends a considerable
part of his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb147" href="#v1pb147"
name="v1pb147">147</a>]</span>time there; and partly on that of
Hywel&rsquo;s essay on the folklore of the county, which was awarded
the prize at the National Eiste&#273;fod of 1898<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5256src" href="#xd26e5256" name="xd26e5256src">23</a>. A story
current at &#7930;anuwch&#7931;yn, concerning a midwife who attends on
a fairy mother, resembles the others of the same group: for one of them
see p. 63 above. In the former, however, one misses the ointment, and
finds instead of it that the midwife was not to touch her eyes with the
water with which she washed the fairy baby. But as might be expected
one of her eyes happened to itch, and she touched it with her fingers
straight from the water. It appears that thenceforth she was able to
see the fairies with that eye; at any rate she is represented some time
afterwards recognizing the father of the fairy baby at a fair at Bala,
and inquiring of him kindly about his family. The fairy asked with
which eye she saw him, and when he had ascertained this, he at once
blinded it, so that she never could see with it afterwards. Hywel also
has it that the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i> formerly used to frequent
the markets at Bala, and that they used to swell the noise in the
market-place without anybody being able to see them: this was a sign
that prices were going to rise.</p>
<p>The shepherds of Ardudwy are familiar, according to Hywel, with a
variant of the story in which a man married a fairy on condition that
he did not touch her with iron. They lived on the Moelfre and dwelt
happily together for years, until one fine summer day, when the husband
was engaged in shearing his sheep, he put the <i lang=
"cy">gwe&#7931;e</i>, &lsquo;shears,&rsquo; in his wife&rsquo;s hand:
she then instantly disappeared. The earlier portions of this story are
unknown to me, but they are not hard to guess. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb148" href="#v1pb148" name=
"v1pb148">148</a>]</span></p>
<p>Concerning &#7930;yn Ir&#273;yn, between the western slopes of the
&#7930;aw&#7931;ech, Hywel has a story the like of which I am not
acquainted with: walking near that lake you shun the shore and keep to
the grass in order to avoid the fairies, for if you take hold of the
grass no fairy can touch you, or dare under any circumstances injure a
blade of grass.</p>
<p>Lastly, Hywel speaks of several caves containing treasure, as for
instance a <i lang="cy">telyn aur</i>, or golden harp, hidden away in a
cave beneath Caste&#7931; Carn Dochan in the parish of
&#7930;anuwch&#7931;yn. Lewis Morris, in his <i>Celtic Remains</i>, p.
100, calls it Caste&#7931; Corndochen, and describes it as seated on
the top of a steep rock at the bottom of a deep valley: it appears to
have consisted of a wall surrounding three turrets, and the mortar
seems composed of cockle-shells: see also the <i lang=
"la">Arch&aelig;ologia Cambrensis</i> for 1850, p. 204. Hywel speaks
also of a cave beneath Caste&#7931; Dinas Br&acirc;n, near
&#7930;ango&#7931;en, as containing much treasure, which will only be
disclosed to a boy followed by a white dog with <i lang=
"cy">&#7931;ygaid arian</i>, &lsquo;silver eyes,&rsquo; explained to
mean light eyes: every such dog is said to see the wind. So runs this
story, but it requires more exegesis than I can supply. One may compare
it at a distance with Myr&#273;in&rsquo;s arrangement that the treasure
buried by him at Dinas Emrys should only be found by a youth with
yellow hair and blue eyes, and with the belief that the cave treasures
of the Snowdon district belong to the <i lang="cy">Gwy&#273;yl</i> or
Goidels, and that Goidels will eventually find them: see chapter
viii.</p>
<p>The next three stories are from Mr. Owen Edwards&rsquo; <i lang=
"cy">Cymru</i> for 1897, pp. 188&ndash;9, where he has published them
from a collection made for a literary competition or local
Eiste&#273;fod by his friend J. H. Roberts, who died in early manhood.
The first is a blurred version of the story of the Lake Lady and her
dowry of cattle, but <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb149" href=
"#v1pb149" name="v1pb149">149</a>]</span>enough of the story remains to
show that, had we got it in its original form, it would be found to
differ somewhat on several points from all the other versions extant. I
summarize the Welsh as follows:&mdash;In ages gone by, as the shepherd
of Hafod y Garreg was looking after his sheep on the shores of the
Arennig Lake, he came across a young calf, plump, sleek, and strong, in
the rushes. He could not guess whence the beast could have come, as no
cattle were allowed to approach the lake at that time of the year. He
took it home, however, and it was reared until it was a bull,
remarkable for his fine appearance. In time his offspring were the only
cattle on the farm, and never before had there been such beasts at
Hafod y Garreg. They were the wonder and admiration of the whole
country. But one summer afternoon in June, the shepherd saw a little
fat old man playing on a pipe, and then he heard him call the cows by
their names&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">

</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Mulican, Molican, Malen and Mair,</p>
<p class="line">Come now home at my word.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">He then beheld the whole herd running to the little
man and going into the lake. Nothing more was heard of them, and it was
everybody&rsquo;s opinion that they were the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth
Teg&rsquo;s</i> cattle.</p>
<p>The next is a quasi fairy tale, the outcome of which recalls the
adventure of the farmer of Drws y Coed on his return from
Be&#273;gelert Fair, p. 99 above. It is told of a young harpist who was
making his way across country from his home at Yspyty Ifan to the
neighbourhood of Bala, that while crossing the mountain he happened in
the mist to lose his road and fall into the Gors Fawr, &lsquo;the big
bog.&rsquo; There he wallowed for hours, quite unable to extricate
himself in spite of all his efforts. But when he was going to give up
in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb150" href="#v1pb150" name=
"v1pb150">150</a>]</span>despair, he beheld close to him, reaching him
her hand, a little woman who was wondrous fair beyond all his
conception of beauty, and with her help he got out of the Gors. The
damsel gave him a jolly sweet kiss that flashed electricity through his
whole nature: he was at once over head and ears in love. She led him to
the hut of her father and mother: there he had every welcome, and he
spent the night singing and dancing with Olwen, for that was her name.
Now, though the harpist was a mere stripling, he thought of wedding at
once&mdash;he was never before in such a heaven of delight. But next
morning he was waked, not by a kiss from Olwen, but by the Plas Drain
shepherd&rsquo;s dog licking his lips: he found himself sleeping
against the wall of a sheepfold (<i lang="cy">corlan</i>), with his
harp in a clump of rushes at his feet, without any trace to be found of
the family with whom he had spent such a happy night.</p>
<p>The next story recalls Glasynys&rsquo; Einion Las, as given at pp.
111&ndash;5 above: its peculiarity is the part played by the well
introduced. The scene was a turbary near the river called Afon Mynach,
so named from Cwm Tir Mynach, behind the hills immediately north of
Bala:&mdash;Ages ago, as a number of people were cutting turf in a
place which was then moorland, and which is now enclosed ground forming
part of a farm called Nant Hir, one of them happened to wash his face
in a well belonging to the fairies. At dinner-time in the middle of the
day they sat down in a circle, while the youth who had washed his face
went to fetch the food, but suddenly both he and the box of food were
lost. They knew not what to do, they suspected that it was the doing of
the fairies; but the wise man (<i lang="cy">gwr hyspys</i>) came to the
neighbourhood and told them, that, if they would only go to the spot on
the night of full moon in June, they would <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb151" href="#v1pb151" name=
"v1pb151">151</a>]</span>behold him dancing with the fairies. They did
as they were told, and found the moor covered with thousands of little
agile creatures who sang and danced with all their might, and they saw
the missing man among them. They rushed at him, and with a great deal
of trouble they got him out. But oftentimes was Einion missed again,
until at the time of full moon in another June he returned home with a
wondrously fair wife, whose history or pedigree no one knew. Everybody
believed her to be one of the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i>.</p>

<p class="first">There is a kind of fairy tale of which I think I have
hitherto not given the reader a specimen: a good instance is given in
the third volume of the <i lang="cy">Brython</i>, at p. 459, by a
contributor who calls himself Idnerth ab Gwgan, who, I learn from the
Rev. Chancellor Silvan Evans, the editor, was no other than the Rev.
Benjamin Williams, best known to Welsh antiquaries by his bardic name
of Gwyniony&#273;. The preface to the tale is also interesting, so I am
tempted to render the whole into English, as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The fair family were wonderful creatures in the imaginary
world: they encamped, they walked, and they capered a great deal in
former ages in our country, according to what we learn from some of our
old people. It may be supposed that they were very little folks like
the children of <i lang="cy">Rhys &#272;wfn</i>; for the old people
used to imagine that they were wont to visit their hearths in great
numbers in ages gone by. The girls at the farm houses used to make the
hearths clean after supper, and to place a cauldron full of water near
the fire; and so they thought that the fair family came there to play
at night, bringing sweethearts for the young women, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb152" href="#v1pb152" name=
"v1pb152">152</a>]</span>leaving pieces of money on the hob for them in
the morning. Sometimes they might be seen as splendid hosts exercising
themselves on our hills. They were very fond of the mountains of Dyfed;
travellers between Lampeter and Cardigan used to see them on the hill
of &#7930;anwenog, but by the time they had reached there the fairies
would be far away on the hills of &#7930;andyssul, and when one had
reached the place where one expected to see the family together in tidy
array, they would be seen very busily engaged on the tops of Crug y
Balog; when one went there they would be on Blaen Pant ar Fi, moving on
and on to Bryn Bwa, and, finally, to some place or other in the lower
part of Dyfed. Like the soldiers of our earthly world, they were
possessed of terribly fascinating music; and in the autumnal season
they had their rings, still named from them, in which they sang and
danced. The young man of &#7930;ech y Derwy&#273;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5347src" href="#xd26e5347" name="xd26e5347src">24</a> was his
father&rsquo;s only son, as well as heir to the farm; so he was very
dear to his father and his mother, indeed he was the light of their
eyes. Now, the head servant and the son were bosom friends: they were
like brothers together, or rather twin brothers. As the son and the
servant were such friends, the farmer&rsquo;s wife used to get exactly
the same kind of clothes prepared for the servant as for her son. The
two fell in love with two handsome young women of very good reputation
in the neighbourhood. The two couples were soon joined in honest
wedlock, and great was the merry-making on the occasion. The servant
had a suitable place to live in on the farm of &#7930;ech y
Derwy&#273;; but about half a year after the son&rsquo;s marriage,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb153" href="#v1pb153" name=
"v1pb153">153</a>]</span>he and his friend went out for sport, when the
servant withdrew to a wild and retired corner to look for game. He
returned presently for his friend, but when he got there he could not
see him anywhere: he kept looking around for some time for him,
shouting and whistling, but there was no sign of his friend. By-and-by,
he went home to &#7930;ech y Derwy&#273; expecting to see him, but no
one knew anything about him. Great was the sorrow of his family through
the night; and next day the anxiety was still greater. They went to see
the place where his friend had seen him last: it was hard to tell
whether his mother or his wife wept the more bitterly; but the father
was a little better, though he also looked as if he were half mad with
grief. The spot was examined, and, to their surprise, they saw a fairy
ring close by, and the servant recollected that he had heard the sound
of very fascinating music somewhere or other about the time in
question. It was at once agreed that the man had been unfortunate
enough to have got into the ring of the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth</i>, and
to have been carried away by them, nobody knew whither. Weeks and
months passed away, and a son was born to the heir of &#7930;ech y
Derwy&#273;, but the young father was not there to see his child, which
the old people thought very hard. However, the little one grew up the
very picture of his father, and great was his influence over his
grandfather and grandmother; in fact he was everything to them. He grew
up to be a man, and he married a good-looking girl in that
neighbourhood; but her family did not enjoy the reputation of being
kind-hearted people. The old folks died, and their daughter-in-law
also. One windy afternoon in the month of October, the family of
&#7930;ech y Derwy&#273; beheld a tall thin old man, with his beard and
hair white as snow, coming towards the house, and they thought he was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb154" href="#v1pb154" name=
"v1pb154">154</a>]</span>a Jew. The servant maids stared at him, and
their mistress laughed at the &ldquo;old Jew,&rdquo; at the same time
that she lifted the children up one after another to see him. He came
to the door and entered boldly enough, asking about his parents. The
mistress answered him in an unusually surly and contemptuous tone,
wondering why the &ldquo;drunken old Jew had come there,&rdquo; because
it was thought he had been drinking, and that he would otherwise not
have spoken so. The old man cast wondering and anxious looks around on
everything in the house, feeling as he did greatly surprised; but it
was the little children about the floor that drew his attention most:
his looks were full of disappointment and sorrow. He related the whole
of his account, saying that he had been out the day before and that he
was now returning. The mistress of the house told him that she had
heard a tale about her husband&rsquo;s father, that he had been lost
years before her birth while out sporting, whilst her father maintained
that it was not true, but that he had been killed. She became angry,
and quite lost her temper at seeing &ldquo;the old Jew&rdquo; not going
away. The old man was roused, saying that he was the owner of the
house, and that he must have his rights. He then went out to see his
possessions, and presently went to the house of the servant, where, to
his surprise, things had greatly changed; after conversing with an aged
man, who sat by the fire, the one began to scrutinize the other more
and more. The aged man by the fire told him what had been the fate of
his old friend, the heir of &#7930;ech y Derwy&#273;. They talked
deliberately of the events of their youth, but it all seemed like a
dream; in short, the old man in the corner concluded that his visitor
was his old friend, the heir of &#7930;ech y Derwy&#273;, returning
from the land of the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i> after spending half a
hundred years there. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb155" href=
"#v1pb155" name="v1pb155">155</a>]</span>The other old man, with the
snow-white beard, believed in his history, and much did they talk
together and question one another for many hours. The old man by the
fire said that the master of &#7930;ech y Derwy&#273; was away from
home that day, and he induced his aged visitor to eat some food, but,
to the horror of all, the eater fell down dead on the spot<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e5369src" href="#xd26e5369" name=
"xd26e5369src">25</a>. There is no record that an inquest was held over
him, but the tale relates that the cause of it was, that he ate food
after having been so long in the world of the fair family. His old
friend insisted on seeing him buried by the side of his ancestors; but
the rudeness of the mistress of &#7930;ech y Derwy&#273; to her
father-in-law brought a curse on the family that clung to it to distant
generations, and until the place had been sold nine times.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A tale like this is to be found related of Idwal of Nantclwyd, in
<i lang="cy">Cymru Fu</i>, p. 85. I said &lsquo;a tale like
this,&rsquo; but, on reconsidering the matter, I should think it is the
very same tale passed through the hands of Glasynys or some one of his
imitators. Another of this kind will be found in the <i lang=
"cy">Brython</i>, ii. 170, and several similar ones also in Wirt
Sikes&rsquo; book, pp. 65&ndash;90, either given at length, or merely
referred to. There is one kind of variant which deserves special
notice, as making the music to which the sojourner in Faery listens for
scores of years to be that of a bird singing on a tree. A story of the
sort is located by Howells, in his <i>Cambrian Superstitions</i>, pp.
127&ndash;8, at Pant Shon Shencin, near Pencader, in Cardiganshire.
This latter kind of story leads easily up to another development,
namely, to substituting for the bird&rsquo;s warble the song and
felicity of heaven, and for the simple shepherd a pious monk. In
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb156" href="#v1pb156" name=
"v1pb156">156</a>]</span>this form it is located at a place called
&#7930;wyn y Nef, or &lsquo;Heaven&rsquo;s Grove,&rsquo; near Celynnog
Fawr, in Carnarvonshire. It is given by Glasynys in <i lang="cy">Cymru
Fu</i>, pp. 183&ndash;4, where it was copied from the <i lang=
"cy">Brython</i>, iii. 111, in which he had previously published it.
Several versions of it in rhyme came down from the eighteenth century,
and Silvan Evans has brought together twenty-six stanzas in point in
<i>St. David&rsquo;s College Magazine</i> for 1881, pp. 191&ndash;200,
where he has put into a few paragraphs all that is known about the song
of the <i lang="cy">Hen Wr o&rsquo;r Coed</i>, or the Old Man of the
Wood, in his usually clear and lucid style.</p>
<p>A tale from the other end of the tract of country once occupied by a
sprinkling, perhaps, of Celts among a population of Picts, makes the
man, and not the fairies, supply the music. I owe it to the kindness of
the Rev. Andrew Clark, Fellow of Lincoln College, Oxford, who heard it
from the late sexton of the parish of Dollar, in the county of
Clackmannan. The sexton died some twelve years ago, aged seventy: he
had learnt the tale from his father. The following are Mr.
Clark&rsquo;s words:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Glendevon is a parish and village in the Ochils in County
Perth, about five miles from Dollar as you come up Glen Queich and down
by Gloomhill. Glen Queich is a narrowish glen between two grassy
hills&mdash;at the top of the glen is a round hill of no great height,
but very neat shape, the grass of which is always short and trim, and
the ferns on the shoulder of a very marked green. This, as you come up
the glen, seems entirely to block the way. It is called the
&ldquo;Maiden Castle.&rdquo; Only when you come quite close do you see
the path winding round the foot of it. A little further on is a fine
spring bordered with flat stones, in the middle of a neat, turfy spot,
called the &ldquo;Maiden&rsquo;s Well.&rdquo; This road, till the new
toll-road was made on the other side <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb157" href="#v1pb157" name="v1pb157">157</a>]</span>of the hills,
was the thoroughfare between Dollar and Glendevon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The following is the legend, as told by the
&lsquo;Bethrel&rsquo;:&mdash;&lsquo;A piper, carrying his pipes, was
coming from Glendevon to Dollar in the grey of the evening. He crossed
the Garchel (a little stream running into the Queich burn), and looked
at the &ldquo;Maiden Castle,&rdquo; and saw only the grey hillside and
heard only the wind soughing through the bent. He had got beyond it
when he heard a burst of lively music: he turned round, and instead of
the dark knoll saw a great castle, with lights blazing from the
windows, and heard the noise of dancing issuing from the open door. He
went back incautiously, and a procession issuing forth at that moment,
he was caught and taken into a great hall ablaze with lights, and
people dancing on the floor. He had to pipe to them for a day or two,
but he got anxious, because he knew his people would be wondering why
he did not come back in the morning as he had promised. The fairies
seemed to sympathize with his anxiety, and promised to let him go if he
played a favourite tune of his, which they seemed fond of, to their
satisfaction. He played his very best, the dance went fast and furious,
and at its close he was greeted with loud applause. On his release he
found himself alone, in the grey of the evening, beside the dark
hillock, and no sound was heard save the purr of the burn and the
soughing of the wind through the bent. Instead of completing his
journey to Dollar, he walked hastily back to Glendevon to relieve his
folk&rsquo;s anxiety. He entered his father&rsquo;s house and found no
kent face there. On his protesting that he had gone only a day or two
before, and waxing loud in his bewildered talk, a grey old man was
roused from a doze behind the fire; and told how he had heard when a
boy from his father that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb158" href=
"#v1pb158" name="v1pb158">158</a>]</span>a piper had gone away to
Dollar on a quiet evening, and had never been heard or seen since, nor
any trace of him found. He had been in the &ldquo;castle&rdquo; for a
hundred years.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The term <i lang="cy">Plant Rhys &#272;wfn</i> has already been
brought before the reader: it means &lsquo;the Children of <i lang=
"cy">Rhys &#272;wfn</i>,&rsquo; and <i lang="cy">Rhys &#272;wfn</i>
means literally Rhys the Deep, but the adjective in Welsh connotes
depth of character in the sense of shrewdness or cunning. Nay, even the
English <i>deep</i> is often borrowed for use in the same sense, as
when one colloquially says <i lang="cy">un d&icirc;p iawn yw e</i>,
&lsquo;he is a very calculating or cunning fellow.&rsquo; The following
account of Rhys and his progeny is given by Gwyniony&#273; in the first
volume of the <i lang="cy">Brython</i>, p. 130, which deserves being
cited at length:&mdash;&lsquo;There is a tale current in Dyfed, that
there is, or rather that there has been, a country between Cemmes, the
northern Hundred of Pembrokeshire, and Aberdaron in &#7930;eyn. The
chief patriarch of the inhabitants was Rhys &#272;wfn, and his
descendants used to be called after him the Children of Rhys &#272;wfn.
They were, it is said, a handsome race enough, but remarkably small in
size. It is stated that certain herbs of a strange nature grew in their
land, so that they were able to keep their country from being seen by
even the most sharp sighted of invaders. There is no account that these
remarkable herbs grew in any other part of the world excepting on a
small spot, about a square yard in area, in a certain part of Cemmes.
If it chanced that a man stood alone on it, he beheld the whole of the
territory of <i lang="cy">Plant Rhys &#272;wfn</i>; but the moment he
moved he would lose sight of it altogether, and it would have been
utterly vain for him to look for his footprints. In another story, as
will be seen presently, the requisite platform was a turf from St.
David&rsquo;s churchyard. The Rhysians had not much land&mdash;they
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb159" href="#v1pb159" name=
"v1pb159">159</a>]</span>lived in towns. So they were wont in former
times to come to market to Cardigan, and to raise the prices of things
terribly. They were seen of no one coming or going, but only seen there
in the market. When prices happened to be high, and the corn all sold,
however much there might have been there in the morning, the poor used
to say to one another on the way home, &ldquo;Oh! <i>they</i> were
there to-day,&rdquo; meaning <i lang="cy">Plant Rhys &#272;wfn</i>. So
they were dear friends in the estimation of Si&ocirc;n Phil Hywel, the
farmer; but not so high in the opinion of Dafy&#273;, the labourer. It
is said, however, that they were very honest and resolute men. A
certain Gruffy&#273; ab Einon was wont to sell them more corn than
anybody else, and so he was a great friend of theirs. He was honoured
by them beyond all his contemporaries by being led on a visit to their
home. As they were great traders like the Ph&oelig;nicians of old, they
had treasures from all countries under the sun. Gruffy&#273;, after
feasting his eyes to satiety on their wonders, was led back by them
loaded with presents. But before taking leave of them, he asked them
how they succeeded in keeping themselves safe from invaders, as one of
their number might become unfaithful, and go beyond the virtue of the
herbs that formed their safety. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; replied the little
old man of shrewd looks, &ldquo;just as Ireland has been blessed with a
soil on which venomous reptiles cannot live, so with our land: no
traitor can live here. Look at the sand on the sea-shore: perfect unity
prevails there, and so among us. Rhys, the father of our race, bade us,
even to the most distant descendant, honour our parents and ancestors;
love our own wives without looking at those of our neighbours; and do
our best for our children and grandchildren. And he said that if we did
so, no one of us would ever prove unfaithful to another, or
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb160" href="#v1pb160" name=
"v1pb160">160</a>]</span>become what you call a traitor. The latter is
a wholly imaginary character among us; strange pictures are drawn of
him with his feet like those of an ass, with a nest of snakes in his
bosom, with a head like the devil&rsquo;s, with hands somewhat like a
man&rsquo;s, while one of them holds a large knife, and the family lies
dead around the figure. Good-bye!&rdquo; When Gruffy&#273; looked about
him he lost sight of the country of <i lang="cy">Plant Rhys</i>, and
found himself near his home. He became very wealthy after this, and
continued to be a great friend of <i lang="cy">Plant Rhys</i> as long
as he lived. After Gruffy&#273;&rsquo;s death they came to market
again, but such was the greed of the farmers, like Gruffy&#273; before
them, for riches, and so unreasonable were the prices they asked for
their corn, that the Rhysians took offence and came no more to Cardigan
to market. The old people used to think that they now went to Fishguard
market, as very strange people were wont to be seen there.&rsquo; On
the other hand, some Fishguard people were lately of opinion that it
was at Haverfordwest the fairies did their marketing: I refer to a
letter of Mr. Ferrar Fenton&rsquo;s, in the <i>Pembroke County
Guardian</i> of October 31, 1896, in which he mentions a conversation
he had with a Fishguard woman as to the existence of fairies:
&lsquo;There are fairies,&rsquo; she asserted, &lsquo;for they came to
Ha&rsquo;rfordwest market to buy things, so there <i>must</i>
be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With this should be compared pp. 9&ndash;10 of Wirt Sikes&rsquo;
<i>British Goblins</i>, where mention is made of sailors on the coast
of Pembrokeshire and Carmarthenshire, &lsquo;who still talk of the
green meadows of enchantment lying in the Irish Channel to the west of
Pembrokeshire,&rsquo; and of men who had landed on them, or seen them
suddenly vanishing. The author then proceeds to abstract from
Howells&rsquo; <i>Cambrian Superstitions</i>, p. 119, the following
paragraph:&mdash;&lsquo;The fairies inhabiting these <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb161" href="#v1pb161" name=
"v1pb161">161</a>]</span>islands are said to have regularly attended
the markets at Milford Haven and Laugharne. They made their purchases
without speaking, laid down their money and departed, always leaving
the exact sum required, which they seemed to know without asking the
price of anything. Sometimes they were invisible; but they were often
seen by sharp-eyed persons. There was always one special butcher at
Milford Haven upon whom the fairies bestowed their patronage instead of
distributing their favours indiscriminately. The Milford Haven folk
could see the green Fairy Islands distinctly, lying out a short
distance from land; and the general belief was that they were densely
peopled with fairies. It was also said that the latter went to and fro
between the islands and the shore, through a subterranean gallery under
the bottom of the sea.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Another tale given in the <i lang="cy">Brython</i>, ii. 20, by a
writer who gives his name as B. Davies<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5470src" href="#xd26e5470" name="xd26e5470src">26</a>, will serve
to show, short though it be, that the term <i lang="cy">Plant Rhys
&#272;wfn</i> was not confined to those honestly dealing fairies, but
was used in a sense wholly synonymous with that of <i lang="cy">Tylwyth
Teg</i>, as understood in other parts of Wales. The story runs as
follows, and should be compared with the Dyffryn Mymbyr one given
above, pp. 100&ndash;3:&mdash;&lsquo;One calm hot day, when the sun of
heaven was brilliantly shining, and the hay in the dales was being
busily made by lads and lasses, and by grown-up people of both sexes, a
woman in the neighbourhood of Emlyn placed her one-year-old infant in
the <i lang="cy">gader</i>, or chair, as the cradle is called in these
parts, and out she went to the field for a while, intending to return,
when her <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb162" href="#v1pb162" name=
"v1pb162">162</a>]</span>neighbour, an old woman overtaken by the
decrepitude of eighty summers, should call to her that her darling was
crying. It was not long before she heard the old woman calling to her;
she ran hurriedly, and as soon as she set foot on the kitchen floor she
took her little one in her arms as usual, saying to him, &ldquo;O my
little one! thy mother&rsquo;s delight art thou! I would not take the
world for thee, &amp;c.&rdquo; But to her surprise he had a very old
look about him, and the more the tender-hearted mother gazed at his
face, the stranger it seemed to her, so that at last she placed him in
the cradle and told her trouble and sorrow to her relatives and
acquaintances. And after this one and the other had given his opinion,
it was agreed at last that it was one of <i lang="cy">Rhys
&#272;wfn&rsquo;s</i> children that was in the cradle, and not her
dearly loved baby. In this distress there was nothing to do but to
fetch a sorcerer, as fast as the fastest horse could gallop. He said,
when he saw the child, that he had seen his like before, and that it
would be a hard job to get rid of him, though not such a very hard job
this time. The shovel was made red hot in the fire by one of the
Cefnarth<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5488src" href="#xd26e5488" name=
"xd26e5488src">27</a> boys, and held before the child&rsquo;s face; and
in an instant the short little old man took to his heels, and neither
he nor his like was seen afterwards from Aber Cuch to Aber Bargoed at
any rate. The mother, it is said, found her darling unscathed the next
moment. I remember also hearing that the strange child was as old as
the grandfather of the one that had been lost.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As I see no reason to make any profound distinction between lake
maidens and sea maidens, I now give Gwyniony&#273;&rsquo;s account of
the mermaid who was found <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb163" href=
"#v1pb163" name="v1pb163">163</a>]</span>by a fisherman from
&#7930;andydoch or St. Dogmael&rsquo;s<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5495src" href="#xd26e5495" name="xd26e5495src">28</a>, near
Cardigan: see the <i lang="cy">Brython</i>, i. 82:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;One fine afternoon in September, in the beginning of the last
century, a fisherman, whose name was Pergrin<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5633src" href="#xd26e5633" name="xd26e5633src">29</a>, went to a
recess in the rock near Pen Cemmes, where he found a sea maiden doing
her hair, and he took the water lady prisoner to his
boat&#8202;&hellip;. We know not what language is used by sea maidens
&hellip; but this one, this time at any rate, talked, it is said, very
good Welsh; for when she was in despair in Pergrin&rsquo;s custody,
weeping copiously, and with her tresses all dishevelled, she called
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb164" href="#v1pb164" name=
"v1pb164">164</a>]</span>out: &lsquo;Pergrin, if thou wilt let me go, I
will give thee three shouts in the time of thy greatest need.&rsquo;
So, in wonder and fear, he let her go to walk the streets of the deep,
and visit her sweethearts there. Days and weeks passed without Pergrin
seeing her after this; but one hot afternoon, when the sea was pretty
calm, and the fishermen had no thought of danger, behold his old
acquaintance showing her head and locks, and shouting out in a loud
voice: &lsquo;Pergrin! Pergrin! Pergrin! take up thy nets, take up thy
nets, take up thy nets!&rsquo; Pergrin and his companion instantly
obeyed the message, and drew their nets in with great haste. In they
went, past the bar, and by the time they had reached the Pwll Cam the
most terrible storm had overspread the sea, while he and his companion
were safe on land. Twice nine others had gone out with them, but they
were all drowned without having the chance of obeying the warning of
the water lady.&rsquo; Perhaps it is not quite irrelevant to mention
here the armorial bearings which Drayton ascribes to the neighbouring
county of Cardigan in the following couplet in his <i>Battaile of
Agincourt</i> (London, 1631), p. 23:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">As Cardigan the next to them that went,</p>
<p class="line">Came with a Mermayd sitting on a Rock.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">A writer in the <i lang="cy">Brython</i>, iv. 194,
states that the people of Nefyn in &#7930;eyn claim the story of the
fisher and the mermaid as belonging to them, which proves that a
similar legend has been current there: add to this the fact mentioned
in the <i lang="cy">Brython</i>, iii. 133, that a red mermaid with
yellow hair, on a white field, figures in the coat of arms of the
family resident at Glasfryn in the parish of &#7930;angybi, in
Eifiony&#273; or the southern portion of Carnarvonshire; and we have
already suggested that Glasynys&rsquo; story (pp. 117&ndash;25) was
made <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb165" href="#v1pb165" name=
"v1pb165">165</a>]</span>up, to a certain extent, of materials found on
the coasts of Carnarvonshire. A small batch of stories about South
Wales mermaids is given by a writer who calls himself Ab Nadol<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e5662src" href="#xd26e5662" name=
"xd26e5662src">30</a>, in the <i lang="cy">Brython</i>, iv. 310, as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A few rockmen are said to have been working, about eighty
years ago, in a quarry near Porth y Rhaw, when the day was calm and
clear, with nature, as it were, feasting, the flowers shedding sweet
scent around, and the hot sunshine beaming into the jagged rocks.
Though an occasional wave rose to strike the romantic cliffs, the sea
was like a placid lake, with its light coverlet of blue attractive
enough to entice one of the ladies of <i lang="cy">Rhys &#272;wfn</i>
forth from the town seen by Daniel Huws off Trefin as he was journeying
between Fishguard and St. David&rsquo;s in the year 1858, to make her
way to the top of a stone and to sit on it to disentangle her flowing
silvery hair. Whilst she was cleaning herself, the rockmen went down,
and when they got near her they perceived that, from her waist upwards,
she was like the lasses of Wales, but that, from her waist downwards,
she had the body of a fish. And, when they began to talk to her, they
found she spoke Welsh, though she only uttered the following few words
to them: &ldquo;Reaping in Pembrokeshire and weeding in
Carmarthenshire.&rdquo; Off she then went to walk in the depth of the
sea towards her home. Another tale is repeated about a mermaid, said to
have been caught by men below the land of &#7930;anwnda, near the spot,
if not on the spot, where the French made their landing afterwards, and
three miles to the west of Fishguard. It then goes on to say that they
carried her to their home, and kept her in a secure place for
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb166" href="#v1pb166" name=
"v1pb166">166</a>]</span>some time; before long, she begged to be
allowed to return to the brine land, and gave the people of the house
three bits of advice; but I only remember one of them,&rsquo; he
writes, &lsquo;and this is it: &ldquo;Skim the surface of the pottage
before adding sweet milk to it: it will be whiter and sweeter, and less
of it will do.&rdquo; I was told that this family follow the three
advices to this day.&rsquo; A somewhat similar advice to that about the
pottage is said to have been given by a mermaid, under similar
circumstances, to a Manxman.</p>
<p>After putting the foregoing bits together, I was favoured by Mr.
Benjamin Williams with notes on the tales and on the persons from whom
he heard them: they form the contents of two or three letters, mostly
answers to queries of mine, and the following is the substance of
them:&mdash;Mr. Williams is a native of the valley of Troed yr
Aur<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5677src" href="#xd26e5677" name=
"xd26e5677src">31</a>, in the Cardiganshire parish of that name. He
spent a part of his youth at Verwig, in the angle between the northern
bank of the Teifi and Cardigan Bay. He heard of Rhys &#272;wfn&rsquo;s
Children first from a distant relative of his father&rsquo;s, a
Catherine Thomas, who came to visit her daughter, who lived not far
from his father&rsquo;s house: that would now be from forty-eight to
fifty years ago. He was very young at the time, and of Rhys
&#272;wfn&rsquo;s progeny he formed a wonderful idea, which was partly
due also to the talk of one James Davies or Si&agrave;ms Mocyn, who was
very well up in folklore, and was one of his father&rsquo;s next-door
neighbours. He was an old man, and nephew to the musician, David
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb167" href="#v1pb167" name=
"v1pb167">167</a>]</span>Jenkin Morgan. The only spot near Mr.
Williams&rsquo; home, that used to be frequented by the fairies, was
Cefn y Ceirw, &lsquo;the Stag&rsquo;s Ridge,&rsquo; a large farm, so
called from having been kept as a park for their deer by the Lewises of
Aber Nant Bychan. He adds that the late Mr. Philipps, of Aberglasney,
was very fond of talking of things in his native neighbourhood, and of
mentioning the fairies at Cefn y Ceirw. It was after moving to Verwig
that Mr. Williams began to put the tales he heard on paper: then he
came in contact with three brothers, whose names were John, Owen, and
Thomas Evans. They were well-to-do and respectable bachelors, living
together on the large farm of Hafod Ruffy&#273;. Thomas was a man of
very strong common sense, and worth consulting on any subject: he was a
good arithmetician, and a constant reader of the Baptist periodical,
<i lang="cy">Seren Gomer</i>, from its first appearance. He thoroughly
understood the bardic metres, and had a fair knowledge of music. He was
well versed in Scripture, and filled the office of deacon at the
Baptist Chapel. His death took place in the year 1864. Now, the eldest
of the three brothers, the one named John, or Si&ocirc;n, was then
about seventy-five years of age, and he thoroughly believed in the
tales about the fairies, as will be seen from the following short
dialogue:&mdash;</p>
<p>Si&ocirc;n: <i lang="cy">Williams bach, ma&rsquo;n rhaid i bod
nhw&rsquo;i g&acirc;l: yr w i&rsquo;n cofio yn amser Bone fod marchnad

"v1pb168">168</a>]</span>drostyn nhwi; ag y m&acirc; nhwi fel yr hen
si&oacute;wmin yna yn ge&#7931;i gneid pob tric.</i></p>
<p><i>John</i>: &lsquo;My dear Williams, it must be that they exist: I
remember Cardigan market, in the time of Bonaparte, full of corn in the
morning&mdash;enough for a month&mdash;but in less than half an hour it
was all gone. It was impossible to see them: they have as much money as
they like.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Williams</i>: &lsquo;How is it, then, that men did not see them,
John?&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>John</i>: &lsquo;Oh, they have men like us to do the buying for
them; and they can, like those old showmen, do every kind of
trick.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At this kind of display of simplicity on the part of his brother,
Thomas used to smile and say: &lsquo;My brother John believes such
things as those;&rsquo; for he had no belief in them himself. Still it
is from his mouth that Mr. Williams published the tales in the <i lang=
"cy">Brython</i>, which have been reproduced here, that of
&lsquo;Pergrin and the Mermaid,&rsquo; and all about the &lsquo;Heir of
&#7930;ech y Derwy&#273;,&rsquo; not to mention the ethical element in
the account of Rhys &#272;wfn&rsquo;s country and its people, the
product probably of his mind. Thomas Evans, or as he was really called,
Tommos Ifan, was given rather to grappling with the question of the
origin of such beliefs; so one day he called Mr. Williams out, and led
him to a spot about four hundred yards from Bol y Fron, where the
latter then lived: he pointed to the setting sun, and asked Mr.
Williams what he thought of the glorious sunset before them. &lsquo;It
is all produced,&rsquo; he then observed, &lsquo;by the reflection of
the sun&rsquo;s rays on the mist: one might think,&rsquo; he went on to
say, &lsquo;that there was there a paradise of a country full of
fields, forests, and everything that is desirable.&rsquo; And before
they had moved away the grand scene had disappeared, when <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb169" href="#v1pb169" name=
"v1pb169">169</a>]</span>Thomas suggested that the idea of the
existence of the country of Rhys &#272;wfn&rsquo;s Children arose from
the contemplation of that phenomenon. One may say that Thomas Evans was
probably far ahead of the Welsh historians who try to extract history
from the story of <i lang="cy">Cantre&rsquo;r Gwaelod</i>, &lsquo;the
Bottom Hundred,&rsquo; beneath the waves of Cardigan Bay; but what was
seen was probably an instance of the mirage to be mentioned presently.
Lastly, besides Mr. Williams&rsquo; contributions to the <i lang=
"cy">Brython</i>, and a small volume of poetry, entitled <i lang=
"cy">Bria&#7931;en glan Ceri</i>, some tales of his were published by
&#7930;a&#7931;awg in <i>Bygones</i> some years ago, and he had the
prize at the Cardigan Eiste&#273;fod of 1866 for the best collection in
Welsh of the folklore of Dyfed: his recollection was that it contained
in all thirty-six tales of all kinds; but since the manuscript, as the
property of the Committee of that Eiste&#273;fod, was sold, he could
not now consult it: in fact he is not certain as to who the owner of it
may now be, though he has an idea that it is either the Rev. Rees
Williams, vicar of Whitchurch, near Solva, Pembrokeshire, or R. D.
Jenkins, Esq., of Cilbronnau, Cardiganshire. Whoever the owner may be,
he would probably be only too glad to have it published, and I mention
this merely to call attention to it. The Eiste&#273;fod is to be
commended for encouraging local research, and sometimes even for
burying the results in obscurity, but not always.</p>

<p class="first">Before leaving Dyfed I wish to revert to the extract
from Mr. Sikes, p. 161 above. He had been helped partly by the article
on Gavran, in the <i>Cambrian Biography</i>, by William Owen, better
known since as William Owen Pughe and Dr. Pughe, and partly by a note
of Southey&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb170" href=
"#v1pb170" name="v1pb170">170</a>]</span>on the following words in his
<i lang="cy">Madoc</i> (London, 1815), i. III:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Where are the sons of Gavran? where his tribe,</p>
<p class="line">The faithful? following their beloved Chief,</p>
<p class="line">They the Green Islands of the Ocean sought;</p>
<p class="line">Nor human tongue hath told, nor human ear,</p>
<p class="line">Since from the silver shores they went their way,</p>
<p class="line">Hath heard their fortunes.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The Gavran story, I may premise, is based on one of
the Welsh Triads&mdash;i. 34, ii. 41, iii. 80&mdash;and Southey cites
the article in the <i>Cambrian Biography</i>; but he goes on to give
the following statements without indicating on what sources he was
drawing&mdash;the reader has, however, been made acquainted already
with the virtue of a blade of grass, by the brief mention of &#7930;yn
Ir&#273;yn above, p. 148:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of these Islands, or Green Spots of the Floods, there are
some singular superstitions. They are the abode of the <i lang=
"cy">Tylwyth Teg</i>, or the fair family, the souls of the virtuous
Druids, who, not having been Christians, cannot enter the Christian
heaven, but enjoy this heaven of their own. They however discover a
love of mischief, neither becoming happy spirits, nor consistent with
their original character; for they love to visit the earth, and,
seizing a man, inquire whether he will travel above wind, mid wind, or
below wind; above wind is a giddy and terrible passage, below wind is
through bush and brake, the middle is a safe course. But the spell of
security is, to catch hold of the grass, for these Beings have not
power to destroy a blade of grass. In their better moods they come over
and carry the Welsh in their boats. He who visits these Islands
imagines on his return that he has been absent only a few hours, when,
in truth, whole centuries have passed away. If you take a turf from St.
David&rsquo;s churchyard, and stand upon it on the sea shore, you
behold these Islands. A <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb171" href=
"#v1pb171" name="v1pb171">171</a>]</span>man once, who thus obtained
sight of them, immediately put to sea to find them; but they
disappeared, and his search was in vain. He returned, looked at them
again from the enchanted turf, again set sail, and failed again. The
third time he took the turf into his vessel, and stood upon it till he
reached them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A correspondent signing himself &lsquo;the Antient Mariner,&rsquo;
and writing, in the <i>Pembroke County Guardian</i>, from Newport,
Pembrokeshire, Oct. 26, 1896, cites Southey&rsquo;s notes, and adds to
them the statement, that some fifty years ago there was a tradition
amongst the inhabitants of Trevine (Trefin) in his county, that these
Islands could be seen from &#7930;an Non, or Eglwys Non, in that
neighbourhood. To return to <i lang="cy">Madoc</i>, Southey adds to the
note already quoted a reference to the inhabitants of Arran More, on
the coast of Galway, to the effect that they think that they can on a
clear day see Hy-Breasail, the Enchanted Island supposed to be the
Paradise of the Pagan Irish: compare the Phantom City seen in the same
sea from the coast of Clare. Then he asks a question suggestive of the
explanation, that all this is due to &lsquo;that very extraordinary
phenomenon, known in Sicily by the name of Morgaine le Fay&rsquo;s
works.&rsquo; In connexion with this question of mirage I venture to
quote again from the <i>Pembroke County Guardian</i>. Mr. Ferrar
Fenton, already mentioned, writes in the issue of Nov. 1, 1896, giving
a report which he had received one summer morning from Captain John
Evans, since deceased. It is to the effect &lsquo;that once when
trending up the Channel, and passing Grasholm Island, in what he had
always known as deep water, he was surprised to see to windward of him
a large tract of land covered with a beautiful green meadow. It was
not, however, <i>above water</i>, but just a few feet <i>below</i>, say
two or three, so that the grass waved and swam about <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb172" href="#v1pb172" name=
"v1pb172">172</a>]</span>as the ripple flowed over it, in a most
delightful way to the eye, so that as watched it made one feel quite
drowsy. You know, he continued, I have heard old people say there is a
floating island off there, that sometimes rises to the surface, or
nearly, and then sinks down again fathoms deep, so that no one sees it
for years, and when nobody expects it comes up again for a while. How
it may be, I do not know, but that is what they say.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lastly, Mr. E. Perkins, of Penysgwarne, near Fishguard, wrote on
Nov. 2, 1896, as follows, of a changing view to be had from the top of
the Garn, which means the <i lang="cy">Garn Fawr</i>, one of the most
interesting prehistoric sites in the county, and one I have had the
pleasure of visiting more than once in the company of Henry Owen and
Edward Laws, the historians of Pembrokeshire:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;May not the fairy islands referred to by Professor Rhys have
originated from mirages? During the glorious weather we enjoyed last
summer, I went up one particularly fine evening to the top of the Garn
behind Penysgwarne to view the sunset. It would have been worth a
thousand miles&rsquo; travel to go to see such a scene as I saw that
evening. It was about half an hour before sunset&mdash;the bay was calm
and smooth as the finest mirror. The rays of the sun made</p>

<p class="first">and a picture indescribable. As the sun neared the
horizon the rays broadened until the sheen resembled a gigantic golden
plate prepared to hold the brighter sun. No sooner had the sun set than
I saw a striking mirage. To the right I saw a stretch of country
similar to a landscape in this country. A farmhouse and out-buildings
were seen, I will not say quite as distinct as I can see the upper part
of St. David&rsquo;s parish from this Garn, but much more detailed. We
could see fences, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb173" href=
"#v1pb173" name="v1pb173">173</a>]</span>roads, and gateways leading to
the farmyard, but in the haze it looked more like a panoramic view than
a veritable landscape. Similar mirages may possibly have caused our old
<i lang="cy">tadau</i> to think these were the abode of the
fairies.&rsquo;</p>
<p>To return to Mr. Sikes, the rest of his account of the Pembrokeshire
fairies and their green islands, of their Milford butcher, and of the
subterranean gallery leading into their home, comes, as already
indicated, for the most part from Howells. But it does not appear on
what authority Southey himself made departed druids of the fairies. One
would be glad to be reassured on this last point, as such a hypothesis
would fit in well enough with what we are told of the sacrosanct
character of the inhabitants of the isles on the coast of Britain in
ancient times. Take, for instance, the brief account given by Plutarch
of one of the isles explored by a certain Demetrius in the service of
the Emperor of Rome: see chapter viii.</p>

<p class="first">Mr. Craigfryn Hughes, the author of a Welsh
novelette<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5832src" href="#xd26e5832" name=
"xd26e5832src">32</a> with its scene laid in Glamorgan, having induced
me to take a copy, I read it and found it full of local colouring. Then
I ventured to sound the author on the question of fairy tales, and the
reader will be able to judge how hearty the response has been. Before
reproducing the tale which Mr. Hughes has sent me, I will briefly put
into English his account of himself and his authorities. Mr. Hughes
lives at the Quakers&rsquo; Yard in the neighbourhood of
Pontypri&#273;, in Glamorganshire. His father was not a
believer<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5837src" href="#xd26e5837" name=
"xd26e5837src">33</a> in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb174" href=
"#v1pb174" name="v1pb174">174</a>]</span>tales about fairies or the
like, and he learned all he knows of the traditions about them in his
father&rsquo;s absence, from his grandmother and other old people. The
old lady&rsquo;s name was Rachel Hughes. She was born at Pandy Pont y
Cymmer, near Pontypool, or <i lang="cy">Pont ap Hywel</i> as Mr. Hughes
analyses the name, in the year 1773, and she had a vivid recollection
of Edmund Jones of the Tranch, of whom more anon, coming from time to
time to preach to the Independents there. She came, however, to live in
the parish of &#7930;anfabon, near the Quakers&rsquo; Yard, when she
was only twelve years of age; and there she continued to live to the
day of her death, which took place in 1864, so that she was about
ninety-one years of age at the time. Mr. Hughes adds that he remembers
many of the old inhabitants besides his grandmother, who were perfectly
familiar with the story he has put on record; but only two of them were
alive when he wrote to me in 1881, and these were both over ninety
years old, with their minds overtaken by the childishness of age; but
it was only a short time since the death of another, who was, as he
says, a walking library of tales about corpse candles, ghosts, and
<i lang="cy">Bendith y Mamau</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e5849src"
href="#xd26e5849" name="xd26e5849src">34</a>, or &lsquo;The
Mothers&rsquo; Blessing,&rsquo; as the fairies are usually called in
Glamorgan. Mr. Hughes&rsquo; father tried to prevent his children being
taught any tales about ghosts, corpse <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb175" href="#v1pb175" name="v1pb175">175</a>]</span>candles, or
fairies; but the grandmother found opportunities of telling them
plenty, and Mr. Hughes vividly describes the effect on his mind when he
was a boy, how frightened he used to feel, how he pulled the clothes
over his head in bed, and how he half suffocated himself thereby under
the effects of the fear with which the tales used to fill him. Then, as
to the locality, he makes the following remarks:&mdash;&lsquo;There are
few people who have not heard something or other about the old
graveyard of the Quakers, which was made by Lydia Phil, a lady who
lived at a neighbouring farm house, called Cefn y Fforest. This old
graveyard lies in the eastern corner of the parish of Merthyr Tydfil,
on land called Pantannas, as to the meaning of which there is much
controversy. Some will have it that it is properly Pant yr Aros, or the
Hollow of the Staying, because travellers were sometimes stopped there
overnight by the swelling of the neighbouring river; others treat it as
Pant yr Hanes, the Hollow of the Legend, in allusion to the following
story. But before the graveyard was made, the spot was called Rhyd y
Grug, or the Ford of the Heather, which grows thereabouts in abundance.
In front of the old graveyard towards the south the rivers Taff and
Bargoed, which some would make into Byrgoed or Short-Wood, meet with
each other, and thence rush in one over terrible cliffs of rock, in the
recesses of which lie huge <i lang="cy">cerwyni</i> or cauldron-like
pools, called respectively the Gerwyn Fach, the Gerwyn Fawr, and the
Gerwyn Ganol, where many a drowning has taken place. As one walks up
over Tarren y Crynwyr, &ldquo;the Quakers&rsquo; Rift,&rdquo; until
Pantannas is reached, and proceeds northwards for about a mile and a
half, one arrives at a farm house called Pen Craig Daf<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e5867src" href="#xd26e5867" name=
"xd26e5867src">35</a>, &ldquo;the Top of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb176" href="#v1pb176" name=
"v1pb176">176</a>]</span>Taff Rock.&rdquo; The path between the two
houses leads through fertile fields, in which may be seen, if one has
eyes to observe, small rings which are greener than the rest of the
ground. They are, in fact, green even as compared with the greenness
around them&mdash;these are the rings in which <i lang="cy">Bendith y
Mamau</i> used to meet to sing and dance all night. If a man happened
to get inside one of these circles when the fairies were there, he
could not be got out in a hurry, as they would charm him and lead him
into some of their caves, where they would keep him for ages, unawares
to him, listening to their music. The rings vary greatly in size, but
in point of form they are all round or oval. I have heard my
grandmother,&rsquo; says Mr. Hughes, &lsquo;reciting and singing
several of the songs which the fairies sang in these rings. One of them
began thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;In one of the centuries gone by, there lived a husbandman on
the farm of Pantannas; and at that time the fairies used to pay
frequent visits to several of the fields which belonged to him. He
cherished in his bosom a considerable hatred for the &ldquo;noisy,
boisterous, and pernicious tribe,&rdquo; as he called them, and often
did he long to be able to discover some way to rid the place of them.
At last he was told by an old witch that the way to get rid of them was
easy enough, and that she would tell him how to attain what he so
greatly wished, if he gave her one evening&rsquo;s milking<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e6182src" href="#xd26e6182" name=
"xd26e6182src">37</a> on his farm, and one morning&rsquo;s. He agreed
to her conditions, and from her he received advice, which was to the
effect that he was to plough all the fields where they had their
favourite resorts, and that, if they found the green sward gone, they
would take offence, and never return to trouble him with their visits
to the spot.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The husbandman followed the advice to the letter, and his
work was crowned with success. Not a single one of them was now to be
seen about the fields, and, instead of the sound of their sweet music,
which used to be always heard rising from the Coarse Meadow Land, the
most complete silence now reigned over their favourite resort.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He sowed his land with wheat and other grain; the verdant
spring had now thrust winter off its throne, and the fields appeared
splendid in their vernal and green livery.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But one evening, when the sun had retired to the chambers of
the west, and when the farmer of Pantannas <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb185" href="#v1pb185" name=
"v1pb185">185</a>]</span>was returning home, he was met by a diminutive
being in the shape of a man, with a red coat on. When he had come right
up to him, he unsheathed his little sword, and, directing the point
towards the farmer, he said:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Vengeance cometh,</p>
<p class="line">Fast it approacheth.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">&lsquo;The farmer tried to laugh, but there was
something in the surly and stern looks of the little fellow which made
him feel exceedingly uncomfortable.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A few nights afterwards, as the family were retiring to rest,
they were very greatly frightened by a noise, as though the house was
falling to pieces; and, immediately after the noise, they heard a voice
uttering loudly the threatening words&mdash;and nothing
more:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Vengeance cometh.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">&lsquo;When, however, the corn was reaped and ready to
be carried to the barn, it was, all of a sudden, burnt up one night, so
that neither an ear nor a straw of it could be found anywhere in the
fields; and now nobody could have set the corn on fire but the
fairies.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As one may naturally suppose, the farmer felt very much on
account of this event, and he regretted in his heart having done
according to the witch&rsquo;s direction, and having thereby brought
upon him the anger and hatred of the fairies.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The day after the night of the burning of the corn, as he was
surveying the destruction caused by the fire, behold the little fellow,
who had met him a few days before, met him again, and, with a
challenging glance, he pointed his sword towards him,
saying:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">It but beginneth.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The farmer&rsquo;s face turned as white as marble, and
he stood calling the little fellow to come back; but the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb186" href="#v1pb186" name=
"v1pb186">186</a>]</span>dwarf proved very unyielding and reluctant to
turn to him; but, after long entreaty, he turned back, asking the
farmer, in a surly tone, what he wanted, when he was told by the latter
that he was quite willing to allow the fields, in which their favourite
resorts had been, to grow again into a green sward, and to let them
frequent them as often as they wished, provided they would no further
wreak their anger on him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;No,&rdquo; was the determined reply, &ldquo;the
word of the king has been given, that he will avenge himself on thee to
the utmost of his power; and there is no power on the face of creation
that will cause it to be withdrawn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The farmer began to weep at this, and, after a while, the
little fellow said that he would speak to his lord on the matter, and
that he would let him know the result, if he would come there to meet
him at the hour of sunset on the third day after.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The farmer promised to meet him; and, when the time appointed
for meeting the little man came, he found him awaiting him, and he was
told by him that his lord had seriously considered his request, but
that, as the king&rsquo;s word was ever immutable, the threatened
vengeance was to take effect on the family. On account, however, of his
repentance, it would not be allowed to happen in his time or that of
his children.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That calmed the disturbed mind of the farmer a good deal. The
fairies began again to pay frequent visits to the place, and their
melodious singing was again heard at night in the fields around.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&lsquo;A century passed by without seeing the threatened vengeance
carried into effect; and, though the Pantannas family were reminded now
and again that it was certain <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb187"
href="#v1pb187" name="v1pb187">187</a>]</span>sooner or later to come,
nevertheless, by long hearing the voice that said&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Vengeance cometh,</p>
</div>
<p class="first">they became so accustomed to it, that they were ready
to believe that nothing would ever come of the threat.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The heir of Pantannas was paying his addresses to the
daughter of a neighbouring landowner who lived at the farm house called
Pen Craig Daf, and the wedding of the happy pair was to take place in a
few weeks, and the parents on both sides appeared exceedingly content
with the union that was about to take place between the two
families.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was Christmas time, and the intended wife paid a visit to
the family of her would-be husband. There they had a feast of roast
goose prepared for the occasion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The company sat round the fire to relate amusing tales to
pass the time, when they were greatly frightened by a piercing voice,
rising, as it were, from the bed of the river<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6245src" href="#xd26e6245" name="xd26e6245src">38</a>, and
shrieking:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">The time for revenge is come.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">&lsquo;They all went out to listen if they could hear
the voice a second time, but nothing was to be heard save the angry
noise of the water as it cascaded over the dread cliffs of the <i lang=
"cy">kerwyni</i>; they had not long, however, to wait till they heard
again the same voice rising above the noise of the waters, as they
boiled over the shoulders of the rock, and crying:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">The time is come.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">&lsquo;They could not guess what it meant, and so
great was their fright and astonishment, that no one could utter a word
to another. Shortly they returned to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb188" href="#v1pb188" name="v1pb188">188</a>]</span>house, when
they believed that beyond doubt the building was being shaken to its
foundations by some noise outside. When all were thus paralysed by
fear, behold a little woman made her appearance on the table, which
stood near the window.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;What dost thou, ugly little thing, want
here?<span class="corr" id="xd26e6268" title=
"Source: &rsquo;">&rdquo;</span> asked one of those present.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;I have nothing to do with thee, O man of the
meddling tongue,&rdquo; said the little woman, &ldquo;but I have been
sent here to recount some things that are about to happen to this
family and another family in the neighbourhood, things that might be of
interest to them; but, as I have received such an insult from the black
fellow that sits in the corner, the veil that hides them from their
sight shall not be lifted by me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;Pray,&rdquo; said another of those present,
&ldquo;if thou hast in thy possession any knowledge with regard to the
future of any one of us that would interest us to hear, bring it
forth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;No, I will but merely tell you that a certain
maiden&rsquo;s heart is like a ship on the coast, unable to reach the
harbour because the pilot has lost heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As soon as she had cried out the last word, she vanished, no
one knew whither or how.</p>
<p>&lsquo;During her visit, the cry rising from the river had stopped,
but soon afterwards it began again to proclaim:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">The time of vengeance is come;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">nor did it cease for a long while. The company had
been possessed by too much terror for one to be able to address
another, and a sheet of gloom had, as it were, been spread over the
face of each. The time for parting came, and Rhy&#273;erch the heir
went to escort Gwerfyl, his lady-love, home towards Pen Craig Daf, a
journey from which he never returned. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb189" href="#v1pb189" name="v1pb189">189</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;Before bidding one another &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; they are
said to have sworn to each other eternal fidelity, even though they
should never see one another from that moment forth, and that nothing
should make the one forget the other.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is thought probable that the young man Rhy&#273;erch, on
his way back towards home, got into one of the rings of the fairies,
that they allured him into one of their caves in the Ravens&rsquo;
Rift, and that there he remained.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&lsquo;It is high time for us now to turn back towards Pantannas and
Pen Craig Daf. The parents of the unlucky youth were almost beside
themselves: they had no idea where to go to look for him, and, though
they searched every spot in the place, they failed completely to find
him or any clue to his history.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A little higher up the country, there dwelt, in a cave
underground, an aged hermit called Gweiry&#273;, who was regarded also
as a sorcerer. They went a few weeks afterwards to ask him whether he
could give them any information about their lost son; but it was of
little avail. What that man told them did but deepen the wound and give
the event a still more hopeless aspect. When they had told him of the
appearance of the little woman, and the doleful cry heard rising from
the river on the night when their son was lost, he informed them that
it was the judgement threatened to the family by the fairies that had
overtaken the youth, and that it was useless for them to think of ever
seeing him again: possibly he might make his appearance after
generations had gone by, but not in their lifetime.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Time rolled on, weeks grew into months, and months into
years, until Rhy&#273;erch&rsquo;s father and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb190" href="#v1pb190" name=
"v1pb190">190</a>]</span>mother were gathered to their ancestors. The
place continued the same, but the inhabitants constantly changed, so
that the memory of Rhy&#273;erch&rsquo;s disappearance was fast dying
away. Nevertheless there was one who expected his return all the while,
and hoped, as it were against hope, to see him once more. Every morn,
as the gates of the dawn opened beyond the castellated heights of the
east, she might be seen, in all weathers, hastening to the top of a
small hill, and, with eyes full of the tears of longing, gazing in
every direction to see if she could behold any sign of her
beloved&rsquo;s return; but in vain. At noon, she might be seen on the
same spot again; she was also there at the hour when the sun was wont
to hide himself, like a red-hot ball of fire, below the horizon. She
gazed until she was nearly blind, and she wept forth her soul from day
to day for the darling of her heart. At last they that looked out at
the windows began to refuse their service, and the almond tree
commenced to crown her head with its virgin bloom. She continued to
gaze, but he came not. Full of days, and ripe for the grave, death put
an end to all her hopes and all her expectations. Her mortal remains
were buried in the graveyard of the old Chapel of the Fan<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e6302src" href="#xd26e6302" name=
"xd26e6302src">39</a>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Years passed away like smoke, and generations like the
shadows of the morning, and there was no longer anybody alive who
remembered Rhy&#273;erch, but the tale of his sudden missing was
frequently in people&rsquo;s mouths. And we ought to have said that
after the event no one of the fairies was seen about the neighbourhood,
and the sound of their music ceased from that night. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb191" href="#v1pb191" name=
"v1pb191">191</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;Rhy&#273;erch had been allured by them, and they took him
away into their cave. When he had stayed there only a few days, as he
thought, he asked for permission to return, which was readily granted
him by the king. He issued from the cave when it was a fine noon, with
the sun beaming from the bosom of a cloudless firmament. He walked on
from the Ravens&rsquo; Rift until he came near the site of the Fan
Chapel; but what was his astonishment to find no chapel there! Where,
he wondered, had he been, and how long away? So with mixed feelings he
directed his steps towards Pen Craig Daf, the home of his beloved one,
but she was not there nor any one whom he knew either. He could get no
word of the history of his sweetheart, and those who dwelt in the place
took him for a madman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He hastened then to Pantannas, where his astonishment was
still greater. He knew nobody there, and nobody knew anything about
him. At last the man of the house came in, and he remembered hearing
his grandfather relating how a youth had suddenly disappeared, nobody
knew whither, some hundreds of years previously. Somehow or other the
man of the house chanced to knock his walking-stick against
Rhy&#273;erch, when the latter vanished in a shower of dust. Nothing
more was ever heard of him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Before leaving Glamorgan, I may add that Mr. Sikes associates fairy
ladies with Crymlyn Lake, between Briton Ferry and Swansea; but, as
frequently happens with him, he does not deign to tell us whence he got
the legend. &lsquo;It is also believed,&rsquo; he says at p. 35,
&lsquo;that a large town lies swallowed up there, and that the <i lang=
"cy">Gwrage&#273; Annwn</i> have turned the submerged walls to use as
the superstructure of their fairy palaces. Some claim to have seen the
towers of beautiful castles lifting their battlements beneath the
surface of the dark <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb192" href=
"#v1pb192" name="v1pb192">192</a>]</span>waters, and fairy bells are at
times heard ringing from those towers.&rsquo; So much by the way: we
shall return to Crymlyn in chapter vii.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The other day, as I was going to Gwent, I chanced to
be in the Golden Valley in Herefordshire, where the names in the
churchyards seem largely to imply a Welsh population, though the Welsh
language has not been heard there for ages. Among others I noticed
Joneses and Williamses in abundance at Abbey Dore, Evanses and Bevans,
Morgans, Prossers and Prices, not to mention Sayces&mdash;that is to
say, Welshmen of English extraction or education&mdash;a name which may
also be met with in Little England in Pembrokeshire, and probably on
other English-Welsh borders. Happening to have to wait for a train at
the Abbey Dore station, I got into conversation with the tenants of a
cottage hard by, and introduced the subject of the fairies. The old man
knew nothing about them, but his wife, Elizabeth Williams, had been a
servant girl at a place called Pen P&ocirc;ch, which she pronounced
with the Welsh guttural <i>ch</i>: she said that it is near
&#7930;andeilo Cressenny in Monmouthshire. It was about forty years ago
when she served at Pen P&ocirc;ch, and her mistress&rsquo; name was
Evans, who was then about fifty years of age. Now Mrs. Evans was in the
habit of impressing on her servant girls&rsquo; minds, that, unless
they made the house tidy before going to bed, and put everything in its
place overnight, the little people&mdash;the fairies, she thinks she
called them&mdash;would leave them no rest in bed at night, but would
come and &lsquo;pinch them like.&rsquo; If they put everything in its
place, and left the house &lsquo;tidy like,&rsquo; it would be all
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb193" href="#v1pb193" name=
"v1pb193">193</a>]</span>right, and &lsquo;nobody would do anything to
them like.&rsquo; That is all I could get from her without prompting
her, which I did at length by suggesting to her that the fairies might
leave the tidy servants presents, a shilling &lsquo;on the hearth or
the hob like.&rsquo; Yes, she thought there was something of that sort,
and her way of answering me suggested that this was not the first time
she had heard of the shilling. She had never been lucky enough to have
had one herself, nor did she know of anybody else that &lsquo;had got
it like.&rsquo;</p>
<p>During a brief but very pleasant sojourn at &#7930;anover in May,
1883, I made some inquiries about the fairies, and obtained the
following account from William Williams, who now, in his seventieth
year, works in Lady &#7930;anover&rsquo;s garden:&mdash;&lsquo;I know
of a family living a little way from here at &mdash;&mdash;, or as they
would now call it in English &mdash;&mdash;, whose ancestors, four
generations ago, used to be kind to <i lang="cy">Bendith y Mamau</i>,
and always welcomed their visits by leaving at night a basinful of
bread and milk for them near the fire. It always used to be eaten up
before the family got up in the morning. But one night a naughty
servant man gave them instead of milk a bowlful of urine<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e6335src" href="#xd26e6335" name=
"xd26e6335src">40</a>. They, on finding it out, threw it about the
house and went away disgusted. But the servant watched in the house the
following night. They found him out, and told him that he had made
fools of them, and that in punishment for his crime there would always
be a fool, i.e. an idiot, in his family. As a matter of fact, there was
one among his children afterwards, and there is one in the family now.
They have always been in a bad way ever since, and they never prosper.
The name of the man who originally <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb194" href="#v1pb194" name="v1pb194">194</a>]</span>offended the
fairies was &mdash;&mdash;; and the name of the present fool among his
descendants is &mdash;&mdash;.&rsquo; For evident reasons it is not
desirable to publish the names.</p>
<p>Williams spoke also of a sister to his mother, who acted as servant
to his parents. There were, he said, ten stepping stones between his
father&rsquo;s house and the well, and on every one of these stones his
aunt used to find a penny every morning, until she made it known to
others, when, of course, the pennies ceased coming. He did not know why
the fairies gave money to her, unless it was because she was a most
tidy servant.</p>
<p>Another &#7930;anover gardener remembered that the fairies used to
change children, and that a certain woman called Nani Fach in that
neighbourhood was one of their offspring; and he had been told that
there were fairy rings in certain fields not far away in &#7930;anover
parish.</p>
<p>A third gardener, who is sixty-eight years of age, and is likewise
in Lady &#7930;anover&rsquo;s employ, had heard it said that servant
girls about his home were wont to sweep the floor clean at night, and
to throw crumbs of bread about on it before going to bed.</p>
<p>Lastly, Mrs. Gardner of Ty Uchaf &#7930;anover, who is ninety years
of age, remembers having a field close to Capel Newy&#273; near Blaen
Afon, in &#7930;anover Uchaf, pointed out to her as containing fairy
rings; and she recollects hearing, when she was a child, that a man had
got into one of them. He remained away from home, as they always did,
she said, a whole year and a day; but she has forgotten how he was
recovered. Then she went on to say that her father had often got up in
the night to see that his horses were not taken out and ridden about
the fields by <i lang="cy">Bendith y Mamau</i>; for they were wont to
ride people&rsquo;s horses late at night round the four corners of the
fields, and thereby they often <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb195"
href="#v1pb195" name="v1pb195">195</a>]</span>broke the horses&rsquo;
wind. This, she gave me to understand, was believed in the parish of
&#7930;anover and that part of the country generally. So here we have
an instance probably of confounding fairies with witches.</p>
<p>I have not the means at my command of going at length into the
folklore of Gwent, so I will merely mention where the reader may find a
good deal about it. I have already introduced the name of the credulous
old Christian, Edmund Jones of the Tranch: he published at Trefecca in
the year 1779 a small volume entitled, <i>A Geographical, Historical,
and Religious Account of the Parish of Aberystruth in the County of
Monmouth, to which are added Memoirs of several Persons of Note who
lived in the said Parish</i>. In 1813, by which time he seems to have
left this world for another, where he expected to understand all about
the fairies and their mysterious life, a small volume of his was
published at Newport, bearing the title, <i>A Relation of Apparitions
of Spirits in the County of Monmouth and the Principality of Wales,
with other notable Relations from England, together with Observations
about them, and Instructions from them, designed to confute and to
prevent the Infidelity of denying the Being and Apparition of Spirits,
which tends to Irreligion and Atheism. By the late Rev. Edmund Jones,
of the Tranch.</i> Naturally those volumes have been laid under
contribution by Mr. Sikes, though the tales about apparitions in them
are frequently of a ghastly nature, and sometimes loathsome: on the
whole, they remind me more than anything else I have ever read of
certain Breton tales which breathe fire and brimstone: all such begin
to be now out of fashion in Protestant countries. I shall at present
only quote a passage of quite a different nature from the earlier
volume, p. 72&mdash;it is an interesting one, and it runs
thus:&mdash;&lsquo;It was the general opinion in times past, when these
things were very <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb196" href="#v1pb196"
name="v1pb196">196</a>]</span>frequent, that the fairies knew whatever
was spoken in the air without the houses, not so much what was spoken
in the houses. I suppose they chiefly knew what was spoken in the air
at night. It was also said that they rather appeared to an uneven
number of persons, to one, three, five, &amp;c.; and oftener to men
than to women. Thomas William Edmund, of Havodavel, an honest pious
man, who often saw them, declared that they appeared with one bigger
than the rest going before them in the company.&rsquo; With the notion
that the fairies heard everything uttered out of doors may be compared
the faculty attributed to the great magician king, Math ab Mathonwy, of
hearing any whisper whatsoever that met the wind: see the Oxford
<i>Mabinogion</i>, p. 60, and Guest&rsquo;s <i>Mabinogion</i>, iii.
219; see also respectively pp. 94, 96, and pp. 308, 310, as to the same
faculty belonging to the fairy people of the Corannians, and the
strange precautions taken against them by the brothers
&#7930;&ucirc;&#273; and &#7930;evelys. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

was by no means unusual for a Welsh <i lang="cy">Gwyl Fabsant</i> to

name &#7930;an Dydoch occurs in the Bruts, <span class="sc">A.D.</span>
987 and 1089, and is the one still in use in Welsh; but the English
<i>St. Dogmael&rsquo;s</i> shows that it is derived from that of
Dogfael&rsquo;s name when the mutation consonant <i>f</i> or <i>v</i>
was still written <i>m</i>. In Welsh the name of the saint has been
worn down to <i lang="cy">Dogwel</i>, as in St. Dogwell&rsquo;s near
Fishguard, and &#7930;an&#273;ogwel in &#7930;anrhu&#273;lad parish in
Anglesey: see Reece&rsquo;s <i>Welsh Saints</i>, p. 211. It points back
to an early Brythonic form <i lang="cy">Doco-maglos</i>, with <i lang=
"cy">doco</i> of the same origin as Latin <i lang="la">dux</i>,
<i>d&#365;cis</i>, &lsquo;a leader,&rsquo; and <i lang="cy">maglo-s</i>
= Irish <i lang="ga">m&#257;l</i>, &lsquo;a lord or prince.&rsquo;
Dogfael&rsquo;s name assumes in &#7930;an <i lang="cy">Dydoch</i> a
Goidelic form, for Dog-fael would have to become in Irish <i lang=
"ga">Doch-mh&#257;l</i>, which, cut down to <i lang="cy">Doch</i> with
the honorific prefix <i>to</i>, has yielded <i lang="cy">Ty-doch</i>;
but I am not clear why it is not <i lang="cy">Ty-&#273;och</i>. Another
instance of a Goidelic form of a name having the local preference in
Wales to this day offers itself in <i lang="cy">Cyfelach</i> and
&#7930;an <i lang="cy">Gyfelach</i> in Glamorganshire. The Welsh was
formerly <i lang="cy">Cimeliauc</i> (Reece, p. 274). Here may also be
mentioned St. Cyngar, otherwise called <i lang="cy">Docwinnus</i>
(Reece, p. 183), but the name occurs in the Liber Landavensis in the
genitive both as <i>Docunn-i</i> and <i>Docguinni</i>, the former of
which seems easily explained as Goidelic for an early form of <i lang=
"cy">Cyngar</i>, namely <i>Cuno-caros</i>, from which would be formed
<i>To-chun</i> or <i>Do-chun</i>. This is what seems to underlie the
Latin <i lang="la">Docunnus</i>, while <i>Docguinni</i> is possibly a
Goidelic modification of the written <i>Docunni</i>, unless some such a
name as <i>Doco-vindo-s</i> has been confounded with <i>Docunnus</i>.
In one instance the Book of &#7930;an D&acirc;v has instead of <i>Abbas
Docunni</i> or <i>Docguinni</i>, the shorter designation, <i>Abbas
Dochou</i> (p. 145), which one must not unhesitatingly treat as
<i>Dochon</i>, seeing that <i>Dochou</i> would be in later book Welsh
<i>Dochau</i>, and in the dialect of the district <i>Docha</i>; and
that this occurs in the name of the church of &#7930;andough near
Cardiff, and &#7930;andough near Cowbridge. The connexion of a certain
saint Dochdwy with these churches does not appear at all satisfactorily
established, but more light is required to help one to understand these
and similar church names.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

folklore the death of his father at the age of seventy-six, in the year
1889, had been a great loss to him; for he adds that he was perfectly
familiar <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb174n" href="#v1pb174n" name=

had associated with older men. Among the latter he had been used to
talk with an old man whose father remembered Cromwell passing on his
way to destroy the Iron Works of Pant y Gwaith, where the Cavaliers had
had a cannon cast, which was afterwards used in the engagement at St.
Fagan&rsquo;s.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

<p class="first">In the previous chapters, the fairy lore of the
Principality was hastily skimmed without any method; and I fear that,
now I have to reproduce some of the things which I gleaned somewhat
later, there will be, if possible, still less method. The general
reader, in case he chances on these pages, will doubtless feel that, as
soon as he has read a few of the tales, the rest seem to be familiar to
him, and exceedingly tiresome. It may be, however, presumed that all
men anxious to arrive at an idea as to the origin among us of the
belief in fairies, will agree that we should have as large and
exhaustive a collection as possible of facts on which to work. If we
can supply the data without stint, the student of anthropology may be
trusted in time to discover their value for his inductions, and their
place in the history of the human race.</p>

<h3 class="main">I.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the course of the summer of 1882<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e6395src" href="#xd26e6395" name="xd26e6395src">1</a> I was a
good deal in Wales, especially Carnarvonshire, and I made notes of a
great many scraps of legends about the fairies, and other bits of
folklore. I will now string <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb198"
href="#v1pb198" name="v1pb198">198</a>]</span>some of them together as
I found them. I began at Trefriw<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6400src"
href="#xd26e6400" name="xd26e6400src">2</a>, in Nant Conwy, where I
came across an old man, born and bred there, called Morris Hughes. He
appears to be about seventy years of age: he formerly worked as a
slater, but now he lives at &#7930;anrwst, and tries to earn a
livelihood by angling. He told me that fairies came a long while ago to
Cowlyd Farm, near Cowlyd Lake, with a baby to dress, and asked to be
admitted into the house, saying that they would pay well for it. Their
request was granted, and they used to leave money behind them. One day
the servant girl accidentally found they had also left some stuff they
were in the habit of using in washing their children. She examined it,
and, one of her eyes happening to itch, she rubbed it with the finger
that had touched the stuff; so when she went to &#7930;anrwst Fair she
saw the same fairy folks there stealing cakes from a standing, and
asked them why they did that. They inquired with what eye she saw them:
she put her hand to the eye, and one of the fairies quickly rubbed it,
so that she never saw any more of them. They were also very fond of
bringing their children to be dressed in the houses between Trefriw and
&#7930;anrwst; and on the flat land bordering on the Conwy they used to
dance, frolic, and sing every moonlight night. Evan Thomas of Sgubor
Gerrig used to have money from them. He has been dead, Morris Hughes
said, over sixty years: he had on his land a sort of cowhouse where the
fairies had shelter, and hence the pay.</p>
<p>Morris, when a boy, used to be warned by his parents <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb199" href="#v1pb199" name=
"v1pb199">199</a>]</span>to take care lest he should be stolen by the
fairies. He knew Thomas Williams of Bryn Sy&#7931;ty, or, as he was
commonly called, Twm Bryn Sy&#7931;ty, who was a changeling. He was a
sharp, small man, afraid of nothing. He met his death some years ago by
drowning near Eglwys Fach, when he was about sixty-three years of age.
There are relatives of his about &#7930;anrwst still: that is,
relatives of his mother, if indeed she was his mother (<i lang="cy">os
oe&#273; hi&rsquo;n fam i&#273;o fo, ynt&eacute;</i>). Lastly, Morris
had a tale about a mermaid cast ashore by a storm near Conway. She
entreated the fishermen who found her to help her back into her native
element; and on their refusing to comply she prayed them to place her
tail at least in the water. A very crude rhyme describes her dying of
exposure to the cold, thus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>Y forforwyn ar y traeth,</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>Crio gwae&#273;u&rsquo;n arw wnaeth,</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>Ofn y deuai drycin drannoeth:</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>Yr hin yn oer a rhewi wnaeth.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">The stranded mermaid on the beach</p>
<p class="line">Did sorely cry and sorely screech,</p>
<p class="line">Afraid to bide the morrow&rsquo;s breeze:</p>
<p class="line">The cold it came, and she did freeze.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">But before expiring, the mermaid cursed the people of
Conway to be always poor, and Conway has ever since, so goes the tale,
laboured under the curse; so that when a stranger happens to bring a
sovereign there, the Conway folk, if silver is required, have to send
across the water to &#7930;ansanffraid for change.</p>
<p>My next informant was John Duncan Maclaren, who was born in 1812,
and lives at Trefriw. His father was a Scotsman, but Maclaren is in all
other respects a Welshman. He also knew the Sgubor Gerrig people, and
that Evan Thomas and Lowri his wife had exceeding great trouble to
prevent their son Roger from being carried away by the fairies. For the
fairy maids were always trying to allure him away, and he was
constantly finding fairy money. The fairy dance, and the playing and
singing that accompanied it, used to take place in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb200" href="#v1pb200" name=
"v1pb200">200</a>]</span>a field in front of his father&rsquo;s house;
but Lowri would never let her son go out after the sun had gone to his
battlements (<i lang="cy">ar ol i&rsquo;r haul fyn&rsquo;d i lawr i
gaera</i>). The most dangerous nights were those when the moon shone
brightly, and pretty wreaths of mist adorned the meadows by the river.
Maclaren had heard of a man, whom he called Si&ocirc;n Catrin of Tyn
Tw&#7931;, finding a penny every day at the <i lang=
"cy">pisty&#7931;</i> or water-spout near the house, when he went there
to fetch water. The flat land between Trefriw and &#7930;anrwst had on
it a great many fairy rings, and some of them are, according to
Maclaren, still to be seen. There the fairies used to dance, and when a
young man got into one of the rings the fairy damsels took him away;
but he could be got out unharmed at the end of a year and a day, when
he would be found dancing with them in the same ring: he must then be
dexterously touched by some one of his friends with a piece of iron and
dragged out at once. This is the way in which a young man whom my notes
connect with a place called Bryn Glas was recovered. He had gone out
with a friend, who lost him, and he wandered into a fairy ring. He had
new shoes on at the time, and his friends brought him out at the end of
the interval of a year and a day; but he could not be made to
understand that he had been away more than five minutes, until he was
asked to look at his new shoes, which were by that time in pieces.
Maclaren had also something to say concerning the history and habitat
of the fairies. Those of Nant Conwy dress in green; and his mother, who
died about sixty-two years ago, aged forty-seven, had told him that
they lived seven years on the earth, seven years in the air, and seven
years underground. He also had a mermaid tale, like that of Pergrin
from Dyfed, p. 163. A fisherman from &#7930;andri&#7931;o yn Rhos,
between Colwyn and &#7930;andudno, had caught <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb201" href="#v1pb201" name=
"v1pb201">201</a>]</span>a mermaid in his net. She asked to be set
free, promising that she would, in case he complied, do him a kindness.
He consented, and one fine day, a long while afterwards, she suddenly
peeped out of the water near him, and shouted: <i lang="cy">Si&ocirc;n
Ifan, cwyd dy rwyda&rsquo; a thyn tua&rsquo;r lan</i>, &lsquo;John
Evans, take up thy nets and make for the shore.&rsquo; He obeyed, and
almost immediately there was a terrible storm, in which many fishermen
lost their lives. The river Conwy is the chief haunt of the mysterious
afanc, already mentioned, p. 130, and Maclaren stated that its name
used to be employed within his memory to frighten girls and children:
so much was it still dreaded. Perhaps I ought to have stated that
Maclaren is very fond of music, and that he told me of a gentleman at
Conway who had taken down in writing a supposed fairy tune. I have made
inquiries of the latter&rsquo;s son, Mr. Hennessy Hughes of Conway; but
his father&rsquo;s papers seem to have been lost, so that he cannot
find the tune in question, though he has heard of it.</p>
<p>Whilst on this question of music let me quote from the &#7930;wyd
letter in the <i>Cambrian Journal</i> for 1859, pp. 145&ndash;6, on
which I have already drawn, pp. 130&ndash;3, above. The passage in
point is to the following effect:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will leave these tales aside whilst I go as far as the Ogo
&#272;u, &ldquo;the Black Cave,&rdquo; which is in the immediate
vicinity of Crigcieth<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6491src" href=
"#xd26e6491" name="xd26e6491src">3</a>, and into which the musicians
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb202" href="#v1pb202" name=
"v1pb202">202</a>]</span>entered so far that they lost their way back.
One of them was heard to play on his pipe, and another on his horn,
about two miles from where they went in; and the place where the piper
was heard is called Braich y Bib, and where the man with the horn was
heard is called Braich y Cornor. I do not believe that even a single
man doubts but that this is all true, and I know not how the airs
called Ffarwel Dic y Piby&#273;, &ldquo;Dick the Piper&rsquo;s
Farewell,&rdquo; and Ffarwel Dwm Bach, &ldquo;Little Tom&rsquo;s
Farewell,&rdquo; had those names, unless it was from the musicians
above mentioned. Nor do I know that Ned Puw may not have been the
third, and that the air called Ffarwel Ned Puw, &ldquo;Ned Pugh&rsquo;s
Farewell,&rdquo; may not have been the last he played before going into
the cave. I cannot warrant this to be true, as I have only heard it
said by one man, and he merely held it as a supposition, which had been
suggested by this air of Ffarwel Dic y Piby&#273;.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A story, however, mentioned by Cyn&#273;elw in the <i lang=
"cy">Brython</i> for 1860, p. 57, makes Ned Pugh enter the cave of Tal
y Clegyr, which the writer in his article identifies with Ness Cliff,
near Shrewsbury. In that cave, which was regarded as a wonderful one,
he says the musician disappeared, while the air he was playing, Ffarwel
Ned Puw, <span class="corr" id="xd26e6554" title=
"Source: &lsquo;">&ldquo;</span>Ned Pugh&rsquo;s Farewell,&rdquo; was
retained in memory of him. Some account of the departure of Ned Pugh
and of the interminable cave into which he entered, will be found given
in a rambling fashion in the <i>Cambrian Quarterly Magazine</i>
(London, 1829), vol. i, pp. 40&ndash;5, where the minstrel&rsquo;s
Welsh name is given as Iolo ap Huw. There we are told that he was last
seen in the twilight of a misty Halloween, and the notes of the tune he
was last heard to play are duly given. One of the surmises as to
Iolo&rsquo;s ultimate fate is also recorded, namely, that in the other
world he has exchanged his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb203" href=
"#v1pb203" name="v1pb203">203</a>]</span>fiddle for a bugle, and become
huntsman-in-chief to Gwyn ab N&ucirc;&#273;, so that every Halloween he
may be found cheering <i lang="cy">Cwn Annwn</i>, &lsquo;the Hounds of
the Other World,&rsquo; over Cader Idris<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6566src" href="#xd26e6566" name="xd26e6566src">4</a>.</p>
<p>The same summer I fell in with Mr. Morris Evans, of Cerrig
M&acirc;n, near Amlwch. He is a mining agent on the Gwydir Estate in
the Vale of Conwy, but he is a native of the neighbourhood of Parys
Mountain, in Anglesey, where he acquired his knowledge of mining. He
had heard fairy tales from his grandmother, Grace Jones, of &#7930;wyn
Ysgaw near Myny&#273; Meche&#7931;, between Amlwch and Holyhead. She
died, nearly ninety years of age, over twenty years ago. She used to
relate how she and others of her own age were wont in their youth to go
out on bright moonlight nights to a spot near &#7930;yn y Bwch. They
seldom had to wait there long before they would hear exquisite music
and behold a grand palace standing on the ground. The diminutive folks
of fairyland would then come forth to dance and frolic. The next
morning the palace would be found gone, but the grandmother used to
pick up fairy money on the spot, and this went on regularly so long as
she did not tell others of her luck. My informant, who is himself a man
somewhat over fifty-two, tells me that at a place not far from
&#7930;yn y Bwch there were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb204"
href="#v1pb204" name="v1pb204">204</a>]</span>plenty of fairy rings to
be seen in the grass; and it is in them the fairies were supposed to
dance<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6652src" href="#xd26e6652" name=
"xd26e6652src">5</a>.</p>
<p>From &#7930;anrwst I went up to see the bard and antiquary, Mr.
Gethin Jones. His house was prettily situated on the hillside on the
left of the road as you approach the village of Penmachno. I was sorry
to find that his memory had been considerably impaired by a paralytic
stroke from which he had suffered not long before. However, from his
room he pointed out to me a spot on the other side of the Machno,
called <i lang="cy">Y Wer&#273;on</i>, which means &lsquo;The Green
Land,&rsquo; or more literally, &lsquo;The Greenery,&rsquo; so to say.
It was well known for its green, grassy fairy rings, formerly
frequented by the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i>; and he said he could
distinguish some of the rings even then from where he stood. The
Wer&#273;on is on the Bennar, and the Bennar is the high ground between
Penmachno and Dolwy&#273;elan. The spot in question is on the part
nearest to the Conwy Falls. This name, <i lang="cy">Y Wer&#273;on</i>,
is liable to be confounded with <i lang="cy">Iwer&#273;on</i>,
&lsquo;Ireland,&rsquo; which is commonly treated as if it began with
the definite article, so that it is made into <i lang="cy">Y
Wer&#273;on</i> and <i lang="cy">Wer&#273;on</i>. The fairy <i lang=
"cy">Wer&#273;on</i>, in the radical form <i lang=
"cy">Gwer&#273;on</i>, not only recalls to my mind the Green Isles
called <i lang="cy">Gwer&#273;onau &#7930;&iuml;on</i>, but also the
saying, common in North Wales, that a person in great anxiety
&lsquo;sees <i lang="cy">Y Wer&#273;on</i>.&rsquo; Thus, for instance,
a man who fails to return to his family at the hour expected, and
believes his people to be in great anxiety about him, expresses himself
by saying that they will have &lsquo;seen the Wer&#273;on on my
account&rsquo; (<i lang="cy">mi fy&#273;an&rsquo; wedi gwel&rsquo;d y
Wer&#273;on am dana&rsquo;i</i>). Is that Ireland, or is it the land of
the fairies, the other world, in fact? <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb205" href="#v1pb205" name="v1pb205">205</a>]</span>If the latter,
it might simply mean they will have died of anxiety; but I confess I
have not so far been able to decide. I am not aware that the term
occurs in any other form of expression than the one I have given; if it
had, and if the Wer&#273;on were spoken of in some other way, that
might possibly clear up the difficulty. If it refers to Ireland, it
must imply that sighting Ireland is equivalent to going astray at sea,
meaning in this sort of instance, getting out of one&rsquo;s senses;
but the Welsh are not very much given to nautical expressions. It
reminds me somewhat of Gerald Griffin&rsquo;s allusion to the Phantom
City, and the penalty paid by those who catch a glimpse of its turrets
as the dividing waves expose them for a moment to view on the western
coast of Ireland:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Soon close the white waters to screen it,</p>
<p class="line">And the bodement, they say, of the wonderful sight,</p>
<p class="line">Is death to the eyes that have seen it.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The Fairy Glen above Bettws y Coed is called in Welsh
Ffos &lsquo;No&#273;yn, &lsquo;the Sink of the Abyss&rsquo;; but Mr.
Gethin Jones told me that it was also called Glyn y Tylwyth Teg, which
is very probable, as some such a designation is required to account for
the English name, &lsquo;the Fairy Glen.&rsquo; People on the Capel
Garmon side used to see the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth</i> playing there, and
descending into the Ffos or Glen gently and lightly without occasioning
themselves the least harm. The Fairy Glen was, doubtless, supposed to
contain an entrance to the world below. This reminds one of the name of
the pretty hollow running inland from the railway station at Bangor.
Why should it be called Nant Uffern, or &lsquo;The Hollow of
Hell&rsquo;? Can it be that there was a supposed entrance to the fairy
world somewhere there? In any case, I am quite certain that Welsh
place-names involve allusions to the fairies <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb206" href="#v1pb206" name=
"v1pb206">206</a>]</span>much oftener than has been hitherto supposed;
and I should be inclined to cite, as a further example, Moel
Eilio<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6709src" href="#xd26e6709" name=
"xd26e6709src">6</a> or Moel Eilian, from the personal name Eilian, to
be mentioned presently. Moel Eilian is a mountain under which the
fairies were supposed to have great stores of treasure. But to return
to Mr. Gethin Jones, I had almost forgotten that I have another
instance of his in point. He showed me a passage in a paper which he
wrote in Welsh some time ago on the antiquities of Yspyty Ifan. He says
that where the Serw joins the Conwy there is a cave, to which tradition
asserts that a harpist was once allured by the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth
Teg</i>. He was, of course, not seen afterwards, but the echo of the
music made by him and them on their harps is still to be heard a little
lower down, under the field called to this day Gweirglo&#273; y
Telynorion, &lsquo;The Harpers&rsquo; Meadow&rsquo;: compare the
extract from Edward &#7930;wyd&rsquo;s correspondence at p. 202
above.</p>
<p>Mr. Gethin Jones also spoke to me of the lake called &#7930;yn
Pencraig, which was drained in hopes of finding lead underneath it, an
expectation not altogether doomed to disappointment, and he informed me
that its old name was &#7930;yn &#7930;ifon; so the moor around it was
called Gwaen &#7930;ifon. It appears to have been a large lake, but
only in wet weather, and to have no deep bed. The names connected with
the spot are now Nant Gwaen &#7930;ifon and the Gwaith (or Mine) of
Gwaen &#7930;ifon: they are, I understand, within the township of
Trefriw. The name &#7930;yn &#7930;ifon is of great interest when taken
in connexion with the Triadic account of the cataclysm called the
Bursting of &#7930;yn &#7930;i&fnof;on. Mr. Gethin Jones, however,
believed himself that &#7930;yn <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb207"
href="#v1pb207" name="v1pb207">207</a>]</span>&#7930;&iuml;on was no
other than Bala Lake, through which the Dee makes her way.</p>

Station, and walked down to &#7930;andwrog in order to see Dinas
Din&#7931;e, and to ascertain what traditions still existed there
respecting Caer Arianrhod, &#7930;ew &#7930;awgyffes, Dylan Eilton, and
other names that figure in the <i>Mabinogi</i> of Math ab Mathonwy. I
called first on the schoolmaster, and he kindly took me to the clerk,
Hugh Evans, a native of the neighbourhood of &#7930;angefni, in
Anglesey. He had often heard people talk of some women having once on a
time come from Tregar Anthreg to Cae&rsquo;r &rsquo;Loda&rsquo;, a
place near the shore, to fetch food or water, and that when they looked
back they beheld the town overflowed by the sea: the walls can still be
seen at low water. Gwennan was the name of one of the women, and she
was buried at the place now called Be&#273; Gwennan, or Gwennan&rsquo;s
Grave. He had also heard the fairy tales of Waen Fawr and Nant y
Bettws, narrated by the antiquary, Owen Williams of the former place.
For instance, he had related to him the tale of the man who slept on a
clump of rushes, and thought he was all the while in a magnificent
mansion; see p. 100, above. Now I should explain that Tregar Anthreg is
to be seen at low water from Dinas Din&#7931;e as a rock not far from
the shore. The Caranthreg which it implies is one of the modern forms
to which Caer Arianrhod has been reduced; and to this has been prefixed
a synonym of <i lang="cy">caer</i>, namely, <i lang="cy">tref</i>,
reduced to <i lang="cy">tre&rsquo;</i>, just as Carmarthen is
frequently called <i lang="cy">Tre&rsquo; Gaerfyr&#273;in</i>.
Cae&rsquo;r &rsquo;Loda&rsquo; is explained as Cae&rsquo;r
Aelodau&rsquo;, &lsquo;The Field of the Limbs&rsquo;; but I am sorry to
say that I forgot to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb208" href=
"#v1pb208" name="v1pb208">208</a>]</span>note the story explanatory of
the name. It is given, I think, to a farm, and so is Be&#273; Gwennan
likewise the name of a farm house. The tenant of the latter, William
Roberts, was at home when I visited the spot. He told me the same
story, but with a variation: three sisters had come from Tregan Anrheg
to fetch provisions, when their city was overflowed. Gwen fled to the
spot now called Be&#273; Gwennan, Elan to Ty&#273;yn Elan, or
Elan&rsquo;s Holding, and Maelan to Rhos Maelan, or Maelan&rsquo;s
Moor; all three are names of places in the immediate neighbourhood.</p>
<p>From Dinas Din&#7931;e I was directed across Lord Newborough&rsquo;s
grounds at Glyn&#7931;ifon to Pen y Groes Station; but on my way I had
an opportunity of questioning several of the men employed at
Glyn&#7931;ifon. One of these was called William Thomas Solomon, an
intelligent middle-aged man, who works in the garden there. He said
that the three women who escaped from the submerged city were sisters,
and that he had learned in his infancy to call them Gwennan bi
D&ocirc;n, Elan bi D&ocirc;n, and Maelan bi D&ocirc;n. Lastly, the name
of the city, according to him, was Tregan Anthrod. I had the following
forms of the name that day:&mdash;Tregar Anrheg, Tregar Anthreg, Tregan
Anrheg, Tregan Anthreg, and Tregan Anthrod. All these are attempts to
reproduce what might be written Tre&rsquo;-Gaer-Arianrhod. The
modification of <i lang="cy">nrh</i> into <i lang="cy">nthr</i> is very
common in North Wales, and Tregar Anrheg seems to have been fashioned
on the supposition that the name had something to do with <i lang=
"cy">anrheg</i>, &lsquo;a gift.&rsquo; Tregan Anthrod is undoubtedly
the Caer Arianrhod, or &lsquo;fortress of Arianrhod,&rsquo; in the
<i>Mabinogi</i>, and it is duly marked as such in a map of
Speede&rsquo;s at the spot where it should be. Now the Arianrhod of the
<i>Mabinogi</i> of Math could hardly be called a lady of rude virtue,
and it is the idea in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb209" href=
"#v1pb209" name="v1pb209">209</a>]</span>neighbourhood that the place
was inundated on account of the wickedness of the inhabitants. So it
would appear that Gwennan, Elan, and Maelan, Arianrhod&rsquo;s sisters,
were the just ones allowed to escape. Arianrhod was probably drowned as
the principal sinner in possession; but I did not find, as I expected,
that the crime which called for such an expiation was in this instance
that of playing cards on Sunday. In fact, this part of the legend does
not seem to have been duly elaborated as yet.</p>
<p>I must now come back to Solomon&rsquo;s <i lang="cy">bi
D&ocirc;n</i>, which puzzles me not a little. Arianrhod was daughter of
D&ocirc;n, and so several other characters in the same <i>Mabinogi</i>
were children of D&ocirc;n. But what is <i lang="cy">bi D&ocirc;n</i>?
I have noticed that all the Welsh antiquaries who take Don out of books
invariably call that personage D&ograve;n or Donn with a short
<i>o</i>, which is wrong, and this has saved me from being deceived
once or twice: so I take it that <i lang="cy">bi D&ocirc;n</i> is, as
Solomon asserted, a local expression of which he did not know the
meaning. I can only add, in default of a better explanation, that
<i lang="cy">bi D&ocirc;n</i> recalled to my mind what I had shortly
before heard on my trip from Aberdaron to Bardsey Island. My wife and
I, together with two friends, engaged, after much eloquent haggling, a
boat at the former place, but one of the men who were to row us
insinuated a boy of his, aged four, into the boat, an addition which
did not exactly add to the pleasures of that somewhat perilous trip
amidst incomprehensible currents. But the Aberdaron boatmen always
called that child <i lang="cy">bi Donn</i>, which I took to have been a
sort of imitation of an infantile pronunciation of &lsquo;baby
John,&rsquo; for his name was John, which Welsh infants as a rule first
pronounce Donn: I can well remember the time when I did. This, applied
to <i lang="cy">Gwennan bi D&ocirc;n</i>, would imply that Solomon
heard it as a piece of nursery lore when he was a child, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb210" href="#v1pb210" name=
"v1pb210">210</a>]</span>and that it meant simply&mdash;Gwennan, baby
or child of D&ocirc;n. Lastly, the only trace of Dylan I could find was
in the name of a small promontory, called variously by the
Glyn&#7931;ifon men Pwynt Maen Tylen, which was Solomon&rsquo;s
pronunciation, and Pwynt Maen Dulan. It is also known, as I was given
to understand, as Pwynt y Wig: I believe I have seen it given in maps
as Maen Dylan Point.</p>
<p>Solomon told me the following fairy tale, and he was afterwards kind
enough to have it written out for me. I give it in his own words, as it
is peculiar in some respects:&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;An old man and his wife lived at the Garth Dorwen in some
period a long while ago. They went to Carnarvon to hire a servant maid
at the Allhallows&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6829src" href=
"#xd26e6829" name="xd26e6829src">8</a> fair; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb212" href="#v1pb212" name=
"v1pb212">212</a>]</span>and it was the custom then for young men and
women who stood out for places to station themselves at the top of the
present <i lang="cy">Maes</i>, by a little green eminence which was
where the present Post-office stands. The old man and his wife went to
that spot, and saw there a lass with yellow hair, standing a little
apart from all the others; the old woman went to her and asked her if
she wanted a place. She replied that she did, and so she hired herself
at once and came to her place at the time fixed. In those times it was
customary during the long winter nights that spinning should be done
after supper. Now the maid servant would go to the meadow to spin by
the light of the moon, and the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i> used to
come to her to sing and dance. But some time in the spring, when the
days had grown longer, Eilian escaped with the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth
Teg</i>, so that she was seen no more. The field where she was last
seen is to this day called Eilian&rsquo;s Field, and the meadow is
known as the Maid&rsquo;s Meadow. The old woman of Garth Dorwen was in
the habit of putting women to bed, and she was in great request far and
wide. Some time after Eilian&rsquo;s escape there came a gentleman on
horseback to the door one night when the moon was full, while there was
a slight rain and just a little mist, to fetch the old woman to his
wife. So she rode off behind the stranger on his horse, and came to
Rhos y Cowrt. Now there was at that time, in the centre of the <i lang=
"cy">rhos</i>, somewhat of a rising ground that looked like an old
fortification, with many big stones on the top, and a large cairn of
stones on the northern side: it is to be seen there to this day, and it
goes by the name of Bryn y Pibion, but I have never visited the spot.
When they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb213" href="#v1pb213" name=
"v1pb213">213</a>]</span>reached the spot, they entered a large cave,
and they went into a room where the wife lay in her bed; it was the
finest place the old woman had seen in her life. When she had
successfully brought the wife to bed, she went near the fire to dress
the baby; and when she had done, the husband came to the old woman with
a bottle of ointment<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6851src" href=
"#xd26e6851" name="xd26e6851src">9</a> that she might anoint the
baby&rsquo;s eyes; but he entreated her not to touch her own eyes with
it. Somehow after putting the bottle by, one of the old woman&rsquo;s
eyes happened to itch, and she rubbed it with the same finger that she
had used to rub the baby&rsquo;s eyes. Then she saw with that eye how
the wife lay on a bundle of rushes and withered ferns in a large cave,
with big stones all round her, and with a little fire in one corner;
and she saw also that the lady was only Eilian, her former servant
girl, whilst, with the other eye, she beheld the finest place she had
ever seen. Not long afterwards the old midwife went to Carnarvon to
market, when she saw the husband, and said to him, &ldquo;How is
Eilian?&rdquo; &ldquo;She is pretty well,&rdquo; said he to the old
woman, &ldquo;but with what eye do you see me?&rdquo; &ldquo;With this
one,&rdquo; was the reply; and he took a bulrush and put her eye out at
once.&rsquo;</p>
<p>That is exactly the tale, my informant tells me, as he heard it from
his mother, who heard it from an old woman who lived at Garth Dorwen
when his mother was a girl, about eighty-four years ago, as he guessed
it to have been; but in his written version he has omitted one thing
which he told me at Glyn&#7931;ifon, namely, that, when the servant
girl went out to the fairies to spin, an enormous amount of spinning
used to be done. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb214" href="#v1pb214"
name="v1pb214">214</a>]</span>I mention this as it reminds me of the
tales of other nations, where the girl who cannot spin straw into gold
is assisted by a fairy, on certain conditions which are afterwards
found very inconvenient. It may be guessed that in the case of Eilian
the conditions involved her becoming a fairy&rsquo;s wife, and that she
kept to them. Lastly, I should like the arch&aelig;ologists of
Carnarvonshire to direct their attention to Bryn y Pibion; for they
might be expected to come across the remains there of a barrow or of a
fort.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The same summer I happened to meet the Rev. Robert
Hughes, of Uwchlaw&rsquo;r Ffynnon, near &#7930;anaelhaearn, a village
on which Tre&rsquo;r Ceiri, or the Town of the Keiri, looks down in its
primitive grimness from the top of one of the three heights of the
Eifl, or Rivals as English people call them. The district is remarkable
for the longevity of its inhabitants, and Mr. Hughes counted fifteen
farmers in his immediate neighbourhood whose average age was
eighty-three; and four years previously the average age of eighteen of
them was no less than eighty-five. He himself was, when I met him,
seventy-one years of age, and he considered that he represented the
traditions of more than a century and a half, as he was a boy of twelve
when one of his grandfathers died at the age of ninety-two: the age
reached by one of his grandmothers was all but equal, while his father
died only a few years ago, after nearly reaching his ninety-fifth
birthday.</p>
<p>Story-telling was kept alive in the parish of &#7930;anaelhaearn by
the institution known there as the <i lang="cy">pilnos</i>, or
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb215" href="#v1pb215" name=
"v1pb215">215</a>]</span>peeling night, when the neighbours met in one
another&rsquo;s houses to spend the long winter evenings dressing hemp
and carding wool, though I guess that a <i lang="cy">pilnos</i> was
originally the night when people met to <i>peel</i> rushes for
rushlights. When they left these merry meetings they were ready, as Mr.
Hughes says, to see anything. In fact, he gives an instance of some
people coming from a <i lang="cy">pilnos</i> across the mountain from
Nant Gwrtheyrn to &#7930;ithfaen, and finding the fairies singing and
dancing with all their might: they were drawn in among them and found
themselves left alone in the morning on the heather. Indeed, Mr. Hughes
has seen the fairies himself: it was on the Pw&#7931;heli road, as he
was returning in the grey of the morning from the house of his
<i>fianc&eacute;e</i> when he was twenty-seven. The fairies he saw came
along riding on wee horses: his recollection is that he now and then
mastered his eyes and found the road quite clear, but the next moment
the vision would return, and he thought he saw the diminutive cavalcade
as plainly as possible. Similarly, a man of the name of Solomon Evans,
when, thirty years ago, making his way home late at night through
Glyn&#7931;ifon Park, found himself followed by quite a crowd of little
creatures, which he described as being of the size of guinea pigs and
covered with red and white spots. He was an ignorant man, who knew no
better than to believe to the day of his death, some eight or nine
years ago, that they were demons. This is probably a blurred version of
a story concerning <i lang="cy">Cwn Annwn</i>, &lsquo;Hell
hounds,&rsquo; such as the following, published by Mr. O. M. Edwards in
his <i lang="cy">Cymru</i> for 1897, p. 190, from Mr. J. H.
Roberts&rsquo; essay mentioned above at p. 148:&mdash;&lsquo;Ages ago
as a man who had been engaged on business, not the most creditable in
the world, was returning in the depth of night across Cefn Creini, and
thinking in a downcast frame of mind <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb216" href="#v1pb216" name="v1pb216">216</a>]</span>over what he
had been doing, he heard in the distance a low and fear-inspiring bark;
then another bark, and another, and then half a dozen and more. Ere
long he became aware that he was being pursued by dogs, and that they
were <i lang="cy">Cwn Annwn</i>. He beheld them coming: he tried to
flee, but he felt quite powerless and could not escape. Nearer and
nearer they came, and he saw the shepherd with them: his face was black
and he had horns on his head. They had come round him and stood in a
semicircle ready to rush upon him, when he had a remarkable
deliverance: he remembered that he had in his pocket a small cross,
which he showed them. They fled in the greatest terror in all
directions, and this accounts for the proverb, <i lang="cy">Mwy
na&rsquo;r cythraul at y groes</i> (Any more than the devil to the
cross).&rsquo; That is Mr. Roberts&rsquo; story; but several allusions
have already been made to <i lang="cy">Cwn Annwn</i>. It would be right
probably to identify them in the first instance with the pack with
which Arawn, king of Annwn, is found hunting by Pwy&#7931;, king of
Dyfed, when the latter happens to meet him in Glyn Cuch in his own
realm. Then in a poem in the <i>Black Book of Carmarthen</i> we find
Gwyn ab N&ucirc;&#273; with a pack led by Dormarth, a hound with a red
snout which he kept close to the ground when engaged in the chase;
similarly in the story of Iolo ab Huw the dogs are treated as belonging
to Gwyn. But on the whole the later idea has more usually been, that
the devil is the huntsman, that his dogs give chase in the air, that
their quarry consists of the souls of the departed, and that their bark
forebodes a death, since they watch for the souls of men about to die.
This, however, might be objected to as pagan; so I have heard the
finishing touch given to it in the neighbourhood of Ystrad Meurig, by
one who, like Mr. Pughe, explained that it is the souls only of
notoriously wicked men and well-known evil livers. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb217" href="#v1pb217" name=
"v1pb217">217</a>]</span>With this limitation the pack<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e6915src" href="#xd26e6915" name=
"xd26e6915src">10</a> seems in no immediate danger of being regarded as
poaching.</p>
<p>To return to &#7930;anaelhaearn, it is right to say that good
spirits too, who attend on good Calvinists, are there believed in.
Morris Hughes, of Cwm Corryn, was the first Calvinistic Methodist at
&#7930;anaelhaearn; he was great-grandfather to Robert Hughes&rsquo;
wife; and he used to be followed by two pretty little yellow birds. He
would call to them, &lsquo;<i lang="cy">Wryd, Wryd!</i>&rsquo; and they
would come and feed out of his hand, and when he was dying they came
and flapped their wings against his window. This was testified to by
John Thomas, of Moelfre Bach, who was present at the time. Thomas died
some twenty-five years ago, at the age of eighty-seven. I have heard
this story from other people, but I do not know what to make of it,
though I may add that the little birds are believed to have been
angels. In Mr. Rees&rsquo; <i>Welsh Saints</i>, pp. 305&ndash;6, Gwryd
is given as the name of a friar who lived about the end of the twelfth
century, and has been commemorated on November 1; and the author adds a
note referring to the <i>Cambrian Register</i> for 1800, vol. iii. p.
221, where it is said that Gwryd relieved the bard Einion ab Gwalchmai
of some oppression, probably mental, which had afflicted him for seven
years. Is one to suppose that Gwryd sent two angels in the form of
little birds to protect the first &#7930;anaelhaearn Methodist? The
call &lsquo;Wryd, Wryd,&rsquo; would seem to indicate that the name was
not originally <i lang="cy">Gwryd</i>, but <i lang="cy">Wryd</i>, to be
identified possibly with the Pictish name <i>Uoret</i> in an
inscription at St. Vigean&rsquo;s, near Arbroath, and to be
distinguished <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb218" href="#v1pb218"
name="v1pb218">218</a>]</span>from the Welsh word <i lang=
"cy">gwryd</i>, &lsquo;valour,&rsquo; and from the Welsh name <i lang=
"cy">Gwriad</i>, representing what in its Gaulish form was
<i>Viriatus</i>. We possibly have the name <i lang="cy">Wryd</i> in
Hafod Wryd, a place in the Machno Valley above Bettws y Coed; otherwise
one would have expected <i lang="cy">Hafod y Gwryd</i>, making
colloquially, <i lang="cy">Hafod Gwryd</i>.</p>
<p>Mr. Hughes told me a variety of things about Nant Gwrtheyrn, one of
the spots where the Vortigern story is localized. The Nant is a sort of
a <i lang="fr">cul de sac</i> hollow opening to the sea at the foot of
the Eifl. There is a rock there called <i lang="cy">Y Farches</i>, and
the angle of the sea next to the old castle, which seems to be merely a
mound, is called <i lang="cy">Y &#7930;ynclyn</i>, or &lsquo;The
Whirlpool&rsquo;; and this is perhaps an important item in the
localizing of Vortigern&rsquo;s city there. I was informed by Mr.
Hughes that the grave of Olfyn is in this Nant, with a razed church
close by: both are otherwise quite unknown to me. Coming away from this
weird spot to the neighbourhood of Celynnog, one finds that the
Pennar&#273; of the <i>Mabinogi</i> of Math is now called Pennarth, and
has on it a well-known cromlech. Of course, I did not leave Mr. Hughes
without asking him about Caer Arianrhod, and I found that he called it
Tre&rsquo; Gaer Anrheg: he described it as a stony patch in the sea,
and it can, he says, be reached on foot when the ebb is at its lowest
in spring and autumn. The story he had heard about it when he was a boy
at school with David Thomas, better known by his bardic name of
<i lang="cy">Dafy&#273; &#272;u Eryri</i>, was the
following:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tregaer Anrheg was inhabited by a family of robbers, and
among other things they killed and robbed a man at Glyn Iwrch, near the
further wall of Glynn&#7931;ifon Park: this completed the measure of
their lawlessness. There was one woman, however, living with them at
Tregaer Anrheg, who was not related to them, and as she went out one
evening with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb219" href="#v1pb219"
name="v1pb219">219</a>]</span>her pitcher to fetch water, she heard a
voice crying out, <i lang="cy">Dos i ben y bryn i wel&rsquo;d
rhyfe&#273;od</i>, that is, Go up the hill to see a wonder. She obeyed,
and as soon as she got to the top of the hill, whereby was meant Dinas
Din&#7931;e, she beheld Tregaer Anrheg sinking in the sea.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As I have wandered away from the fairies I may add the following
curious bit of legend which Mr. Hughes gave me:&mdash;&lsquo;When St.
Beuno lived at Celynnog, he used to go regularly to preach at
&#7930;an&#273;wyn on the opposite side of the water, which he always
crossed on foot. But one Sunday he accidentally dropped his book of
sermons into the water, and when he had failed to recover it a <i lang=
"cy">gylfin-hir</i>, or curlew, came by, picked it up, and placed it on
a stone out of the reach of the tide. The saint prayed for the
protection and favour of the Creator for the <i lang=
"cy">gylfin-hir</i>: it was granted, and so nobody ever knows where
that bird makes its nest.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="first">One day in August of the same summer I went to have
another look at the old inscribed stone at Gesail Gyfarch<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e7022src" href="#xd26e7022" name=
"xd26e7022src">11</a>, near Tremadoc, and, instead of returning the
same way, I walked across to Criccieth Station; but on my way I was
directed to call at a farm house called &#7930;wyn y Mafon Uchaf, where
I was to see Mr. Edward &#7930;ewelyn, a bachelor then seventy-six
years of age. He is a native of the neighbourhood, and has always lived
in it; moreover, he has now been for some time blind. He had heard a
good many fairy tales. Among others he mentioned John Roberts, a slater
from the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb220" href="#v1pb220" name=
"v1pb220">220</a>]</span>Garn, that is Carn Dolbenmaen, as having one
day, when there was a little mist and a drizzling rain, heard a crowd
of fairies talking together in great confusion, near a sheepfold on
&#7930;wytmor Mountain; but he was too much afraid to look at them. He
also told me of a man at Ystum Cegid, a farm not far off, having
married a fairy wife on condition that he was not to touch her with any
kind of iron on pain of her leaving him for ever. Then came the usual
accident in catching a horse in order to go to a fair at Carnarvon, and
the immediate disappearance of the wife. At this point Mr.
&#7930;ewelyn&rsquo;s sister interposed to the effect that the wife did
once return and address her husband in the rhyme, <i lang="cy">Os
by&#273; anwyd ar fy mab</i>, &amp;c.: see pp. 44, 55 above. Then Mr.
&#7930;ewelyn enumerated several people who are of this family, among
others a girl, who is, according to him, exactly like the fairies. This
made me ask what the fairies are like, and he answered that they are
small unprepossessing creatures, with yellow skin and black hair. Some
of the men, however, whom he traced to a fairy origin are by no means
of this description. The term there for men of fairy descent is
<i>Belsiaid</i>, and they live mostly in the neighbouring parish of
Pennant, where it would never do for me to go and collect fairy tales,
as I am told; and Mr. &#7930;ewelyn remembers the fighting that used to
take place at the fairs at Penmorfa if the term <i>Belsiaid</i> once
began to be heard. Mr. &#7930;ewelyn was also acquainted with the tale
of the midwife that went to a fairy family, and how the thieving
husband had deprived her of the use of one eye. He also spoke of the
fairies changing children, and how one of these changelings, supposed
to be a baby, expressed himself to the effect that he had seen the
acorn before the oak, and the egg before the chick, but never anybody
who brewed ale in an egg-shell: see p. 62 above. As to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb221" href="#v1pb221" name=
"v1pb221">221</a>]</span>modes of getting rid of the changelings, a
friend of Mr. &#7930;ewelyn&rsquo;s mentioned the story that one was
once dropped into the Glaslyn river, near Be&#273;gelert. The sort of
children the fairies liked were those that were unlike their own; that
is, bairns whose hair was white, or inclined to yellow, and whose skin
was fair. He had a great deal to say of a certain Elis Bach of Nant
Gwrtheyrn, who used to be considered a changeling. With the exception
of this changing of children the fairies seemed to have been on fairly
good terms with the inhabitants, and to have been in the habit of
borrowing from farm houses a <i lang="cy">pade&#7931;</i> and <i lang=
"cy">grade&#7931;</i> for baking. The <i lang="cy">grade&#7931;</i> is
a sort of round flat iron, on which the dough is put, and the <i lang=
"cy">pade&#7931;</i> is the <i>patella</i> or pan put over it: they are
still commonly used for baking in North Wales. Well, the fairies used
to borrow these two articles, and by way of payment to leave money on
the hob at night. All over &#7930;eyn the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth</i> are
represented as borrowing <i lang="cy">pade&#7931; a grade&#7931;</i>.
They seem to have never been very strong in household furniture,
especially articles made of iron. Mr. &#7930;ewelyn had heard that the
reason why people do not see fairies nowadays is that they have been
exorcised (<i lang="cy">wedi eu hoffrymu</i>) for hundreds of years to
come.</p>
<p>About the same time I was advised to try the memory of Miss Jane
Williams, who lives at the Graig, Tremadoc: she was then, as I was
told, seventy-five, very quick-witted, but by no means communicative to
idlers. The most important information she had for me was to the effect
that the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i> had been exorcised away (<i lang=
"cy">wedi &rsquo;ffrymu</i>) and would not be back in <i>our</i> day.
When she was about twelve she served at the Ge&#7931;i between Tremadoc
and Pont Aberglaslyn. Her master&rsquo;s name was Si&ocirc;n Ifan, and
his wife was a native of the neighbourhood of <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e7094" title="Source: Carnavon">Carnarvon</span>; she had many
tales to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb222" href="#v1pb222" name=
"v1pb222">222</a>]</span>tell them about the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth</i>,
how they changed children, how they allured men to the fairy rings, and
how their dupes returned after a time in a wretched state, with hardly
any flesh on their bones. She heard her relate the tale of a man who
married a fairy, and how she left him; but before going away from her
husband and children she asked the latter by name which they would like
to have, a dirty cow-yard (<i lang="cy">buches fudur</i>) or a clean
cow-yard (<i lang="cy">buches l&acirc;n</i>). Some gave the right
answer, a dirty cow-yard, but some said a clean cow-yard: the lot of
the latter was poverty, for they were to have no stock of cattle. The
same question is asked in a story recorded by the late Rev. Elias Owen,
in his <i>Welsh Folk-lore</i>, p. 82<a class="noteref" id=

<p class="first">When I was staying at Pw&#7931;heli the same summer, I
went out to the neighbouring village of Four Crosses, and found a
native of the place, who had heard a great many curious things from his
mother. His name was Lewis Jones: he was at the time over eighty, and
he had formerly been a saddler. Among other things, his mother often
told him that her grandmother had frequently been with the fairies,
when the latter was a child. She lived at Pl&acirc;s Du, and once she
happened to be up near Carn Bentyrch when she saw them. She found them
resembling little children, and playing in a brook that she had to
cross. She was so delighted with them, and stayed so long with them,
that a search was made for her, when she was found in the company of
the fairies. Another time, they met her as <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb223" href="#v1pb223" name=
"v1pb223">223</a>]</span>she was going on an errand across a large bog
on a misty day, when there was a sort of a drizzle, which one might
call either dew or rain, as it was not decidedly either, but something
between the two, such as the Welsh would call <i lang=
"cy">gwlithlaw</i>, &lsquo;dew-rain.&rsquo; She loitered in their
company until a search was made for her again. Lewis Jones related to
me the story of the midwife&mdash;he pronounced it in Welsh
&lsquo;midwaith&rsquo;&mdash;who attended on a fairy. As in the other
versions, she lost the sight of one eye in consequence of her
discovering the gentleman fairy thieving; but the fair at which this
happened was held in this instance at Nefyn. He related also how a
farmer at Pennant had wedded a fairy called Bella. This tale proceeded
like the other versions, and did not even omit the fighting at
Penmorfa: see pp. 89, 93, 220. He had likewise the tale about the two
youths who had gone out to fetch some cattle, and came, while returning
about dusk, across a party of fairies dancing. The one was drawn into
the circle, and the other was suspected at length of having murdered
him, until, at the suggestion of a wizard, he went to the same place at
the end of a year and a day: then he found him dancing, and managed to
get him out. He had been reduced to a mere skeleton, but he inquired at
once if the cattle he was driving were far ahead. Jones had heard of a
child changed by the fairies when its mother had placed it in some hay
while she worked at the harvest. She discovered he was not her own by
brewing in an egg-shell, as usual. Then she refused to take any notice
of him, and she soon found her own baby returned; but the latter looked
much the worse for its sojourn in the land of the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth
Teg</i>.</p>
<p>My informant described to me Elis Bach of Nant Gwrtheyrn, already
mentioned, p. 221, who died somewhat more than forty years ago. His
father was a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb224" href="#v1pb224"
name="v1pb224">224</a>]</span>farmer there, and his children, both boys
and girls, were like ordinary folks, excepting Elis, who was deformed,
his legs being so short that his body seemed only a few inches from the
ground when he walked. His voice was also small and squeaky. However,
he was very sharp, and could find his way among the rocks pretty well
when he went in quest of his father&rsquo;s sheep and goats, of which
there used to be plenty there formerly. Everybody believed Elis to have
been a changeling, and one saying of his is still remembered in that
part of the country. When strangers visited Nant Gwrtheyrn, a thing
which did not frequently happen, and when his parents asked them to
their table, and pressed them to eat, he would squeak out drily,
<i lang="cy">Buta &lsquo;nynna buta&rsquo;r cwbwl</i>, that is to say,
&lsquo;Eating that means eating all we have.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He told me further that the servant girls used formerly to take care
to bring a supply of water indoors at the approach of night, that the
fairies might find plenty in which to bathe their children, for fear
that they might use the milk instead, if water was wanting. Moreover,
when they had been baking, they took care to leave the fairies both
<i lang="cy">pade&#7931;</i> and <i lang="cy">grade&#7931;</i>, that
they might do their baking in the night. The latter used to pay for
this kindness by leaving behind them a cake of fairy bread and
sometimes money on the hob. I have, however, not been able to learn
anything about the quality or taste of this fairy food.</p>
<p>He had also a great deal to say about the making of bonfires about
the beginning of winter. A bonfire was always kindled on the farm
called Cromlech on the eve of the Winter Calends or <i lang="cy">Nos
Galan Gaeaf</i>, as it is termed in Welsh; and the like were to be seen
in abundance towards &#7930;ithfaen, Carnguwch, and &#7930;anaelhaearn,
as well as on the Merioneth side of the bay. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb225" href="#v1pb225" name=
"v1pb225">225</a>]</span>Besides fuel, each person present used to
throw into the fire a small stone, with a mark whereby he should know
it again. If he succeeded in finding the stone on the morrow, the year
would be a lucky one for him, but the contrary if he failed to recover
it. Those who assisted at the making of the bonfire watched until the
flames were out, and then somebody would raise the usual cry, when each
ran away for his life, lest he should be found last. This cry, which is
a sort of equivalent, well known over Carnarvonshire, of the English
saying, &lsquo;The devil take the hindmost,&rsquo; was in the Welsh of
that county&mdash;</p>

<p class="first">At Nefyn, in &#7930;eyn<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e7368src" href="#xd26e7368" name="xd26e7368src">14</a>, I had some
stories about the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i> from Lowri Hughes, the
widow of John <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb227" href="#v1pb227"
name="v1pb227">227</a>]</span>Hughes, who lives in a cottage at Pen
Isa&rsquo;r Dref, and is over seventy-four years of age. An aunt of
hers, who knew a great many tales, had died about six years before my
visit, at the advanced age of ninety-six. She used to relate to Lowri
how the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth</i> were in the habit of visiting Singrug,
a house now in ruins on the land of Pen Isa&rsquo;r Dref, and how they
had a habit of borrowing a <i lang="cy">pade&#7931;</i> and <i lang=
"cy">grade&#7931;</i> for baking: they paid for the loan of them by
giving their owners a loaf. Her grandmother, who died not long ago at a
very advanced age, remembered a time when she was milking in a corner
of the land of Carn Bod&uuml;an, and how a little dog came to her and
received a blow from her that sent it rolling away. Presently, she
added, the dog reappeared with a lame man playing on a fiddle; but she
gave them no milk. If she had done so, there was no knowing, she said,
how much money she might have got. But, as it was, such singing and
dancing were indulged in by the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth</i> around the
lame fiddler that she ran away as fast as her feet could carry her.
Lowri&rsquo;s husband had also seen the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth</i> at the
break of day, near Madrun Mill, where they seem to have been holding a
sort of conversazione; but presently one of them observed that he had
heard the voice of the hen&rsquo;s husband, and off they went instantly
then. The fairies were in the habit also of dancing and singing on the
headland across which lie the old earthworks called Din&#7931;aen. When
they had played and enjoyed themselves enough, they used to lift a
certain bit of sod and descend to their own land. My informant had also
heard the midwife story, and she was aware that the fairies changed
people&rsquo;s children; in fact, she mentioned to me a farm house not
far off where there was a daughter of this origin then, not to mention
that she knew all about Elis Bach. Another woman whom I <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb228" href="#v1pb228" name=
"v1pb228">228</a>]</span>met near Porth Din&#7931;aen said, that the
Din&#7931;aen fairies were only seen when the weather was a little
misty.</p>
<p>At Nefyn, Mr. John Williams (Alaw &#7930;eyn) got from his mother
the tale of the midwife. It stated that the latter lost the sight of
her right eye at Nefyn Fair, owing to the fairy she there recognized,
pricking her eye with a green rush. During my visit to Aberdaron, my
wife and I went to the top of Myny&#273; Anelog, and on the way up we
passed a cottage, where a very illiterate woman told us that the
<i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i> formerly frequented the mountain when
there was mist on it; that they changed people&rsquo;s children if they
were left alone on the ground; and that the way to get the right child
back was to leave the fairy urchin without being touched or fed. She
also said that, after baking, people left the <i lang=
"cy">grade&#7931;</i> for the fairies to do their baking: they would
then leave a cake behind them as pay. As for the fairies just now, they
have been exorcised (<i lang="cy">wedi&rsquo;ffrymu</i>) for some
length of time. Mrs. Williams, of Pw&#7931; Defaid, told me that the
rock opposite, called Clip y Gylfinir, on Bodwy&#273;og mountain, a
part of Myny&#273; y Rhiw, was the resort of the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth
Teg</i>, and that they revelled there when it was covered with mist;
she added that a neighbouring farm, called Bodermud Isa&rsquo;, was
well known at one time as a place where the fairies came to do their
baking. But the most remarkable tale I had in the neighbourhood of
Aberdaron was from Evan Williams, a smith who lives at Yr Ar&#273; Las,
on Rhos Hirwaen. If I remember rightly, he is a native of
&#7930;aniestin, and what he told me relates to a farmer&rsquo;s wife
who lived at the Nant, in that parish. Now this old lady was frequently
visited by a fairy who used to borrow <i lang="cy">pade&#7931; a
grade&#7931;</i> from her. These she used to get, and she returned them
with a loaf borne on her head in acknowledgement. But one day she came
to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb229" href="#v1pb229" name=
"v1pb229">229</a>]</span>ask for the loan of her <i lang=
"cy">troe&#7931; bach</i>, or wheel for spinning flax. When handing her
this, the farmer&rsquo;s wife wished to know her name, as she came so
often, but she refused to tell her. However, she was watched at her
spinning, and overheard singing to the whir of the wheel:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">

<p class="first">This explains to some extent the <i lang=
"cy">s&igrave;li ffrit</i> sung by a Corwrion fairy when she came out
of the lake to spin: see p. 64 above. At first I had in vain tried to
make out the meaning of that bit of legend; but since then I have also
found the &#7930;aniestin rhyme a little varied at &#7930;anberis: it
was picked up there, I do not exactly know how, by my little girls this
summer. The words as they have them run thus:&mdash;</p>
<div lang="cy" class="lgouter">
<p class="line"><i>Bychan a wy&#273;a&rsquo; hi</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>Mai Trwtyn-Tratyn</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>Yw f&rsquo;enw i.</i></p>
</div>
<p class="first">Here, instead of <i lang="cy">S&igrave;li go Dwt</i>
or <i lang="cy">S&igrave;li ffrit</i>, the name is <i lang=
"cy">Trwtyn-Tratyn</i>, and these doggerels at once remind one of the
tale of Rumpelstiltzchen; but it is clear that we have as yet only the
merest fragments of the whole, though I have been thus far unable to
get any more. So one cannot quite say how far it resembled the tale of
Rumpelstiltzchen: there is certainly one difference, which is at once
patent, namely, that while the German Rumpelstiltzchen was a male
fairy, our Welsh <i lang="cy">S&igrave;li ffrit</i> or <i lang=
"cy">S&igrave;li go Dwt</i> is of the other sex. Probably, in the
&#7930;aniestin tale, the borrowing for baking had nothing to do with
the spinning, for all fairies in &#7930;eyn borrow a <i lang=
"cy">pade&#7931;</i> and a <i lang="cy">grade&#7931;</i>, while they do
not usually appear to spin. Then may we suppose that the spinning was
in this instance done for the farmer&rsquo;s wife on conditions which
she was able to evade by discovering the fairy <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb230" href="#v1pb230" name=
"v1pb230">230</a>]</span>helper&rsquo;s name? At any rate one expects a
story representing the farmer&rsquo;s wife laid under obligation by the
fairy, and not the reverse. I shall have an opportunity of returning to
this kind of tale in chapter x.</p>
<p>The smith told me another short tale, about a farmer who lived not
long ago at Deunant, close to Aberdaron. The latter used, as is the
wont of country people, to go out a few steps in front of his house
every night to &mdash;&mdash; before going to bed; but once on a time,
while he was standing there, a stranger stood by him and spoke to him,
saying that he had no idea how he and his family were annoyed by him.
The farmer asked how that could be, to which the stranger replied that
his house was just below where they stood, and if he would only stand
on his foot he would see that what he said was true. The farmer
complying, put his foot on the other&rsquo;s foot, and then he could
clearly see that all the slops from his house went down the chimney of
the other&rsquo;s house, which stood far below in a street he had never
seen before. The fairy then advised him to have his door in the other
side of his house, and that if he did so his cattle would never suffer
from the <i lang="cy">clwy&rsquo; byr</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e7543src" href="#xd26e7543" name="xd26e7543src">15</a>. The result
was that the farmer obeyed, and had his door walled up and another made
in the other side of the house: ever after he was a most prosperous
man, and nobody was so successful as he in rearing stock in all that
part of the country. To place the whole thing beyond the possibility of
doubt, Evan Williams assured me that he had often seen the
farmer&rsquo;s house with the front door in the back. I mention this
strange story in order to compare it, in the matter of standing on the
fairy&rsquo;s foot, with that of standing with one&rsquo;s foot just
inside a fairy ring. Compare also standing on a particular <span class=

Owen of St. David&rsquo;s College, Lampeter, since appointed Bishop of
St. David&rsquo;s, on a visit to his native place. He took me round to
those of the inhabitants who were thought most likely to have tales to
tell; but I found nothing about the fairies except the usual story of
their borrowing <i lang="cy">pade&#7931; a grade&#7931;</i>, and of
their changing children. However, one version I heard of the process of
recovering the stolen child differs from all others known to me: it was
given us by Margaret Edwards, of Pentre Bach, whose age was then
eighty-seven. It was to the effect that the mother, who had been given
a fairy infant, was to place it on the floor, and that all those
present in the house should throw a piece of iron at it. This she
thought was done with the view of convincing the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth
Teg</i> of the intention to kill the changeling, and in order to induce
them to bring the right child back. The plan was, we are told, always
successful, and it illustrates, to my thinking, the supposed efficacy
of iron against the fairies.</p>
<p>On the way to Aber Soch I passed by an old-fashioned house which has
all the appearance of having once been a place of considerable
importance; and on being told that its name is Caste&#7931;march, I
began thinking of March ab Meirchion mentioned in the Triads. He, I had
long been convinced, ought to be the Welsh reflex of Labhraidh Lorc, or
the Irish king with horse&rsquo;s ears; and the corresponding Greek
character of Midas with ass&rsquo;s ears is so well known that I need
not dwell on it. So I <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb232" href=
"#v1pb232" name="v1pb232">232</a>]</span>undertook to question various
people in the neighbourhood about the meaning of the name of
Caste&#7931;march. Most of them analysed it into <i lang=
"cy">Caste&#7931; y March</i>, the &lsquo;Castle of the Steed,&rsquo;
and explained that the knight of the shire or some other respectable
obscurity kept his horses there. This treatment of the word is not very
decidedly countenanced by the pronunciation, which makes the name into
one word strongly accented on the middle syllable. It was further
related to me how Caste&#7931;march was once upon a time inhabited by a
very wicked and cruel man, one of whose servants, after being very
unkindly treated by him, ran away and went on board a man-of-war. Some
time afterwards the man-of-war happened to be in Cardigan Bay, and the
runaway servant persuaded the captain of the vessel to come and anchor
in the Tudwal Roads. Furthermore he induced him to shell his old
master&rsquo;s mansion; and the story is regarded as proved by the old
bullets now and then found at Caste&#7931;march. It has since been
suggested to me that the bullets are evidence of an attack on the place
during the Civil War, which is not improbable. But having got so far as
to find that there was a wicked, cruel man associated with
Caste&#7931;march, I thought I should at once hear the item of
tradition which I was fishing for; but not so: it was not to be wormed
out in a hurry. However, after tiring a very old blacksmith, whose
memory was far gone, with my questions, and after he had in his turn
tired me with answers of the kind I have already described, I ventured
to put it to him at last whether he had never heard some very silly
tale about the lord of Caste&#7931;march, to the effect that he was not
quite like other men. He at once admitted that he had heard it said
that he had horse&rsquo;s ears, but that he would never have thought of
repeating such nonsense to me. This is not a bad instance of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb233" href="#v1pb233" name=
"v1pb233">233</a>]</span>difficulty which one has in eliciting this
sort of tradition from the people. It is true that, as far as regards
Caste&#7931;march, nothing, as it happens, would have been lost if I
had failed at Aber Soch, for I got the same information later at Sarn
Fy&#7931;teyrn; not to mention that after coming back to my books, and
once more turning over the leaves of the <i lang="cy">Brython</i>, I
was delighted to find the tale there. It occurs at p. 431 of the volume
for 1860. It is given with several other interesting bits of antiquity,
and at the end the editor has put &lsquo;Edward &#7930;wyd,
1693&rsquo;; so I suppose the whole comes from letters emanating from
the great Lhwyd, for so, or rather <i lang="cy">Lhuyd</i>, he preferred
to write his name. It is to the following effect:&mdash;</p>
<p>One of Arthur&rsquo;s warriors, whose name was March (or Parch)
Amheirchion<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7579src" href="#xd26e7579" name=
"xd26e7579src">16</a>, was lord of Caste&#7931;march in &#7930;eyn.
This man had horse&rsquo;s ears (resembling Midas), and lest anybody
should know it, he used to kill every <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb234" href="#v1pb234" name="v1pb234">234</a>]</span>man he sought
to shave his beard, for fear lest he should not be able to keep the
secret; and on the spot where he was wont to bury the bodies there grew
reeds, one of which somebody cut to make a pipe. The pipe would give no
other sound than &lsquo;March Amheirchion has horse&rsquo;s
ears.&rsquo; When the warrior heard this, he would probably have killed
the innocent man on that account, if he had not himself failed to make
the pipe produce any other sound. But after hearing where the reed had
grown, he made no further effort to conceal either the murders or his
ears. This story of Edward &#7930;wyd&rsquo;s clearly goes back to a
time when some kind of a pipe was the favourite musical instrument in
North Wales, and not the harp.</p>

<p class="first">Some time ago I was favoured with a short but
interesting tale by Mr. Evan Lloyd Jones, of Dinorwig, near
&#7930;anberis. Mr. Lloyd Jones, I may here mention, published not long
ago, in <i lang="cy">&#7930;ais y Wlad</i> (Bangor, North Wales), and
in the <i lang="cy">Drych</i> (Utica, United States of North America),
a series of articles entitled <i lang="cy">&#7930;en y Werin yn Sir
Gaernarfon</i>, or the Folklore of Carnarvonshire. I happened to see it
at a friend&rsquo;s house, and I found at once that the writer was
passionately fond of antiquities, and in the habit of making use of the
frequent opportunities he has in the Dinorwig quarries for gathering
information as to what used to be believed by the people of Arfon and
Anglesey. The tale about to be given relates to a lake called Marchlyn
Mawr, or the Great Horse-lake, for there are two lakes called Marchlyn:
they lie near one another, between the Fron&#7931;wyd, in the parish of
&#7930;andegai, and the Elidyr, in the parishes of <span class=

<p>&lsquo;The Marchlyn Mawr is surrounded by rocks terrible to look at,
and tradition relates how one of the sons of the farmer of Rhiwen, once
on a time, when helping a sheep that had fallen among the rocks to get
away, discovered a tremendous cave there; he entered, and saw that it
was full of treasures and arms of great value; but, as it was beginning
to grow dark, and as clambering back was a difficult matter even in the
light of day, he went home that evening, and next morning with the grey
dawn he set out again for the cave, when he found it without much
trouble. He entered, and began to look about him at the treasures that
were there. In the centre of the cave stood a huge table of pure gold,
and on the table lay a crown of gold and pearls. He understood at once
that they were the crown and treasures of Arthur. He approached the
table, and as he stretched forth his hand to take hold of the crown he
was frightened by an awful noise, the noise, as it were, of a thousand
thunders bursting over his head, and the whole place became as dark as
Tartarus. He tried to grope and feel his way out as fast as he could.
When he had succeeded in reaching to the middle of the rocks, he cast
his eye on the lake, which had been stirred all through, while its
white-crested waves dashed through the jagged teeth of the rocks up to
the spot on which he stood. But as he continued looking at the middle
of the lake he beheld a coracle containing three women, the fairest
that the eye of man ever fell on. They were being quickly rowed to the
mouth of the cave; but the dread aspect of him who rowed was enough to
send thrills of horror through the strongest of men. The youth was able
somehow to escape home, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb237" href=
"#v1pb237" name="v1pb237">237</a>]</span>but no health remained in his
constitution after that, and even the mere mention of the Marchlyn in
his hearing used to be enough to make him insane.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Lloyd Jones appends to the tale a note to the following
effect:&mdash;There is a small eminence on the shore of the Marchlyn
Mawr, in the parish of &#7930;andegai, called <i lang="cy">Bryn
Cwrwgl</i>, or the &lsquo;Hill of the Coracle&rsquo;; and <i lang=
"cy">Ogof y Marchlyn</i>, or the &lsquo;Marchlyn Cave,&rsquo; is a name
familiar enough to everybody in these neighbourhoods. There were
some&mdash;unless he ought to say that there still are some&mdash;who
believed that there was abundance of treasure in the cave. Several
young men from the quarries, both of the Cae and of Dinorwig, have been
in the midst of the Marchlyn rocks, searching for the cave, and they
succeeded in making their way into a cave. They came away, however,
without the treasures. One old man, Robert Edwards (Iorwerth Sardis),
used to tell him that he and several others had brought ropes from the
quarry to go into the cave, but that they found no treasure. So far, I
have given the substance of Mr. Jones&rsquo; words, to which I would
add the following statement, which I have from a native of
Dinorwig:&mdash;About seventy years ago, when the gentry were robbing
the poor of these districts of their houses and of the lands which the
latter had enclosed out of the commons, an old woman called Si&acirc;n
William of the Garne&#273; was obliged to flee from her house with her
baby&mdash;the latter was known later in life as the Rev. Robert Ellis,
of Ysgoldy&mdash;in her arms. It was in one of the Marchlyn caves that
she found refuge for a day and night. Another kind of tale connected
with the Marchlyn Mawr is recorded in the Powys-land Club&rsquo;s
<i>Collections, Hist. and Arch.</i>, vol. xv. p. 137, by the Rev. Elias
Owen, to the effect that &lsquo;a man who was fishing in the lake found
himself enveloped in the clouds that had descended <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb238" href="#v1pb238" name=
"v1pb238">238</a>]</span>from the hills to the water. A sudden gust of
wind cleared a road through the mist that hung over the lake, and
revealed to his sight a man busily engaged in thatching a stack. The
man, or rather the fairy, stood on a ladder. The stack and ladder
rested on the surface of the lake.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="first">Mr. E. S. Roberts, of &#7930;andysilio School, near
&#7930;ango&#7931;en (p. 138), has sent me more bits of legends about
the fairies. He heard the following from Mr. Thomas Parry, of Tan y
Coed Farm, who had heard it from his father, the late Evan Parry, and
the latter from Thomas Morris, of Eglwyseg, who related it to him more
than once:&mdash;Thomas Morris happened to be returning home from
&#7930;ango&#7931;en very late on one Saturday night in the middle of
the summer, and by the time he reached near home the day had dawned,
when he saw a number of the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i> with a dog
walking about hither and thither on the declivity of the Eglwyseg
Rocks, which hung threateningly overhead. When he had looked at them
for some minutes, he directed his steps towards them; but as they saw
him approaching they hid themselves, as he thought, behind a large
stone. On reaching the spot, he found under the stone a hole by which
they had made their way into their subterranean home. So ends the tale
as related to Mr. Roberts. It is remarkable as representing the fairies
looking rather like poachers; but there are not wanting others which
speak of their possessing horses and greyhounds, as all gentlemen were
supposed to.</p>
<p>One of Mr. Roberts&rsquo; tales is in point: he had it from Mr. Hugh
Francis<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7747src" href="#xd26e7747" name=
"xd26e7747src">18</a>, of Holyhead House, Ruthin, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb239" href="#v1pb239" name=
"v1pb239">239</a>]</span>and the latter heard it from Robert Roberts,
of Amlwch, who has now been dead about thirty years:&mdash;About 105
years ago there lived in the parish of &#7930;andyfrydog, near
&#7930;annerch y Me&#273;, in Anglesey, a man named Ifan Gruffy&#273;,
whose cow happened to disappear one day. Ifan Gruffy&#273; was greatly
distressed, and he and his daughter walked up and down the whole
neighbourhood in search of her. As they were coming back in the evening
from their unsuccessful quest, they crossed the field called after the
Dyfrydog thief, Cae &#7930;eidr Dyfrydog, where they saw a great number
of little men on ponies quickly galloping in a ring. They both drew
nigh to look on; but Ifan Gruffy&#273;&rsquo;s daughter, in her
eagerness to behold the little knights more closely, got unawares
within the circle in which their ponies galloped, and did not return to
her father. The latter now forgot all about the loss of the cow, and
spent some hours in searching for his daughter; but at last he had to
go home without her, in the deepest sadness. A few days afterwards he
went to Myna&#273;wyn to consult John Roberts, who was a magician of no
mean reputation. That &lsquo;wise man&rsquo; told Ifan Gruffy&#273; to
be no longer sad, since he could get his daughter back at the very hour
of the night of the anniversary of the time when he lost her. He would,
in fact, then see her riding round in the company of the <i lang=
"cy">Tylwyth Teg</i> whom he had seen on that memorable night. The
father was to go there accompanied by four stalwart men, who were to
aid him in the rescue of his daughter. He was to tie a strong rope
round his waist, and by means of this his friends were to pull him out
of the circle when he entered to seize his daughter. He went to the
spot, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb240" href="#v1pb240" name=
"v1pb240">240</a>]</span>and in due time he beheld his daughter riding
round in great state. In he rushed and snatched her, and, thanks to his
friends, he got her out of the fairy ring before the little men had
time to think of it. The first thing Ifan&rsquo;s daughter asked him
was, if he had found the cow, for she had not the slightest reckoning
of the time she had spent with the fairies.</p>
<p>Whilst I am about it, I may as well go through Mr. Roberts&rsquo;
contributions. The next is also a tale related to him by Mr. Hugh
Francis, and, like the last, it comes from Anglesey. Mr. Francis&rsquo;
great-grandfather was called Robert Francis, and he had a mill at
Aberffraw about 100 years ago; and the substance of the following tale
was often repeated in the hearing of Mr. Roberts&rsquo; informant by
his father and his grandfather:&mdash;In winter Robert Francis used to
remain very late at work drying corn in his kiln. As it was needful to
keep a steady fire going, he used to go backwards and forwards from the
house, looking after it not unfrequently until it was two o&rsquo;clock
in the morning. Once on a time he happened to leave a cauldron full of
water on the floor of the kiln, and great was his astonishment on
returning to find two little people washing themselves in the water. He
abstained from entering to disturb them, and went back to the house to
tell his wife of it. &lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;they are
fairies.&rsquo; He presently went back to the kiln and found that they
were gone. He fancied they were man and wife. However, they had left
the place very clean, and to crown all, he found a sum of money left by
them to pay him, as he supposed, for the water and the use of the kiln.
The ensuing night many more fairies came to the kiln, for the visitors
of the previous night had brought their children with them; and the
miller found them busy bathing them and looking very comfortable in the
warm room where they were. The pay that night <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb241" href="#v1pb241" name=
"v1pb241">241</a>]</span>was also more considerable than the night
before, as the visitors were more numerous. After this the miller never
failed to leave a vessel full of water in the kiln every night, and the
fairies availed themselves of it for years, until, in fact, they took
offence at the miller telling the neighbours of the presents of money
which had been left him in the kiln. Thenceforth no fairies were known
to frequent the kiln belonging to the Aberffraw mill.</p>
<p>The last tale communicated to me by Mr. Roberts is the following,
which he elicited from Margaret Davies, his housekeeper, by reading to
her some of the fairy legends published in the <i lang=
"cy">Cymmrodor</i> a short while ago&mdash;probably the Corwrion
series, one of which bears great resemblance to hers. Mrs. Davies, who
is sixty-one years of age, says that when her parents, Edward and Ann
Williams, lived at Rhoslydan, near Bryneglwys, in Yale, some
seventy-five years ago, the servant man happened one day in the spring
to be ploughing in a field near the house. As he was turning his team
back at one end of the field, he heard some one calling out from the
other end, <i lang="cy">Y mae eisieu hoelen yn y p&igrave;l</i>, or
&lsquo;The peel wants a nail&rsquo;; for <i lang="cy">p&igrave;l</i> is
the English <i>peel</i>, a name given to a sort of shovel provided with
a long handle for placing loaves in an oven, and for getting them out
again. When at length the ploughman had reached the end of the field
whence he guessed the call to have proceeded, he there saw a small
peel, together with a hammer and a nail, under the hedge. He saw that
the peel required a nail to keep it together, and as everything
necessary for mending it were there ready to hand, he did as it had
been suggested. Then he followed at the plough-tail until he came round
again to the same place, and there he this time saw a cake placed for
him on the spot where he had previously <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb242" href="#v1pb242" name="v1pb242">242</a>]</span>found the peel
and the other things, which had now disappeared. When the servant
related this to his master, he told him at once that it was one of the
<i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i> of that locality that had called out to
him. With this should be compared the story of the man who mended a
fairy&rsquo;s plough vice: see p. 64 above.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Early this year I had occasion to visit the well-known
Hengwrt Library at Peniarth, and during my stay there Mr. Wynne very
kindly took me to see such of the &#7930;anegryn people as were most
likely to have somewhat to say about the fairies. Many of the
inhabitants had heard of them, but they had no long tales about them.
One man, however, told me of a William Pritchard, of Pentre Bach, near
&#7930;wyngwryl, who died at sixty, over eighty years ago, and of a
Rhys Williams, the clerk of &#7930;angelynin, how they were going home
late at night from a cock-fight at &#7930;anegryn, and how they came
across the fairies singing and dancing on a plot of ground known as
<i lang="cy">Gwastad Meiriony&#273;</i>, &lsquo;the Plain of
Merioneth,&rsquo; on the way from &#7930;wyngwryl to &#7930;anegryn. It
consists, I am told by Mr. Robert Roberts of &#7930;anegryn, of no more
than some twenty square yards, outside which one has a good view of
Cardigan Bay and the heights of Merioneth and Carnarvonshire, while
from the Gwastad itself neither sea nor mountain is visible. On this
spot, then, the belated cockfighters were surrounded by the fairies.
They swore at the fairies and took to their heels, but they were
pursued as far as Claw&#273; Du. Also I was told that Elen Egryn, the
authoress, some sixty years ago, of some poetry called <i lang=
"cy">Telyn Egryn</i>, had also seen fairies in her youth, when she used
to go up the hills to look <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb243" href=
"#v1pb243" name="v1pb243">243</a>]</span>after her father&rsquo;s
sheep. This happened near a little brook, from which she could see the
sea when the sun was in the act of sinking in it; then many fairies
would come out dancing and singing, and also crossing and re-crossing
the little brook. It was on the side of Rhiwfelen, and she thought the
little folks came out of the brook somewhere. She had been scolded for
talking about the fairies, but she firmly believed in them to the end
of her life. This was told me by Mr. W. Williams, the tailor, who is
about sixty years of age; and also by Mr. Rowlands, the ex-bailiff of
Peniarth, who is about seventy-five. I was moreover much interested to
discover at &#7930;anegryn a scrap of kelpie story, which runs as
follows, concerning &#7930;yn Gwernen, situated close to the old road
between Dolge&#7931;ey and &#7930;anegryn:&mdash;</p>
<p>As a man from the village of &#7930;anegryn was returning in the
dusk of the evening across the mountain from Dolge&#7931;ey, he heard,
when hard by &#7930;yn Gwernen, a voice crying out from the
water:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>Daeth yr awr ond ni &#273;aeth y dyn!</i></p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">The hour is come but the man is not!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">As the villager went on his way a little distance,
what should meet him but a man of insane appearance, and with nothing
on but his shirt. As he saw the man making full pelt for the waters of
the lake, he rushed at him to prevent him from proceeding any further.
But as to the sequel there is some doubt: one version makes the
villager conduct the man back about a mile from the lake to a farm
house called Dyffrydan, which was on the former&rsquo;s way home.
Others seem to think that the man in his shirt rushed irresistibly into
the lake, and this I have no doubt comes nearer the end of the story in
its original form. Lately I have heard a part of a similar story about
&#7930;yn Cynnwch, which has already been mentioned, p. 135, above. My
informant <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb244" href="#v1pb244" name=
"v1pb244">244</a>]</span>is Miss Lucy Griffith, of Glynmalden, near
Dolge&#7931;ey, a lady deeply interested in Welsh folklore and Welsh
antiquities generally. She obtained her information from a
Dolge&#7931;ey ostler, formerly engaged at the Ship Hotel, to the
effect that on Gwyl Galan, &lsquo;the eve of New Year&rsquo;s
Day,&rsquo; a person is seen walking backwards and forwards on the
strand of Cynnwch Lake, crying out:&mdash;</p>

<p class="first">The ostler stated also that lights are to be seen on
Cader Idris on the eve of New Year&rsquo;s Day, whatever that statement
may mean. The two lake stories seem to suggest that the Lake Spirit was
entitled to a victim once a year, whether the sacrifice was regarded as
the result of accident or design. By way of comparison, one may mention
the notion, not yet extinct, that certain rivers in various parts of
the kingdom regularly claim so many victims: for some instances at
random see an article by Mr. J. M. Mackinlay, on Traces of River
Worship in Scottish Folklore, a paper published in the <i>Proceedings
of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland</i>, 1895&ndash;6, pp.

<p class="first">In the neighbourhood of Ystrad Meurig, between the
Teifi and the Ystwyth basins, almost everybody can <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb245" href="#v1pb245" name=
"v1pb245">245</a>]</span>relate tales about the fairies, but not much
that is out of the ordinary run of such stories elsewhere. Among
others, Isaac Davies, the smith living at Ystrad Meurig, had heard a
great deal about fairies, and he said that there were rings belonging
to them in certain fields at Tan y Graig and at &#7930;anafan. Where
the rings were, there the fairies danced until the ground became red
and bare of grass. The fairies were, according to him, all women, and
they dressed like foreigners, in short cotton dresses reaching only to
the knee-joint. This description is somewhat peculiar, as the idea
prevalent in the country around is, that the fairy ladies had very long
trains, and that they were very elegantly dressed; so that it is a
common saying there, that girls who dress in a better or more showy
fashion than ordinary look like <i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i>, and the
smith confessed he had often heard that said. Similarly Howells, pp.
113, 121&ndash;2, finds the dresses of the fairies dancing on the
Freni, in the north-east of Pembrokeshire, represented as indescribably
elegant and varying in colour; and those who, in the month of May, used
to frequent the prehistoric encampment of Moe&#273;in<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e7865src" href="#xd26e7865" name="xd26e7865src">19</a> or
Moy&#273;in&mdash;from which a whole cantred takes its name in Central
Cardiganshire&mdash;as fond of appearing in green; while blue
petticoats are said, he says, to have prevailed in the fairy dances in
North Wales<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7880src" href="#xd26e7880" name=
"xd26e7880src">20</a>.</p>
<p>Another showed me a spot on the other side of the Teifi, where the
<i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i> had a favourite spot for <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb246" href="#v1pb246" name=
"v1pb246">246</a>]</span>dancing; and at the neighbouring village of
Swy&#273; Ffynnon, another meadow was pointed out as their resort on
the farm of D&ocirc;l Bydy&euml;. According to one account I had there,
the fairies dressed themselves in very long clothes, and when they
danced they took hold of one another&rsquo;s enormous trains. Besides
the usual tales concerning men enticed into the ring and retained in
Faery for a year and a day, and concerning the fairies&rsquo; dread of
<i lang="cy">pren cerdingen</i> or mountain ash, I had the midwife tale
in two or three forms, differing more or less from the versions current
in North Wales. For the most complete of them I am indebted to one of
the young men studying at the Grammar School, Mr. D. &#7930;edrodian
Davies. It used to be related by an old woman who died some thirty
years ago at the advanced age of about 100. She was P&agrave;li, mother
of old Rachel Evans, who died seven or eight years ago, when she was
about eighty. The latter was a curious character, who sometimes sang
<i lang="cy">maswe&#273;</i>, or rhymes of doubtful propriety, and used
to take the children of the village to see fairy rings. She also used
to see the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth</i>, and had many tales to tell of
them. But her mother, P&agrave;li, had actually been called to attend
at the confinement of one of them. The beginning of the tale is not
very explicit; but, anyhow, P&agrave;li one evening found herself face
to face with the fairy lady she was to attend upon. She appeared to be
the wife of one of the princes of the country. She was held in great
esteem, and lived in a very grand palace. Everything there had been
arranged in the most beautiful and charming fashion. The wife was in
her bed with nothing about her but white, and she fared sumptuously. In
due time, when the baby had been born, the midwife had all the care
connected with dressing it and serving its mother. P&agrave;li could
see or hear nobody in the whole place but <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb247" href="#v1pb247" name="v1pb247">247</a>]</span>the mother and
the baby. She had no idea who attended on them, or who prepared all the
things they required, for it was all done noiselessly and secretly. The
mother was a charming person, of an excellent temper and easy to
manage. Morning and evening, as she finished washing the baby,
P&agrave;li had a certain ointment given her to rub the baby with. She
was charged not to touch it but with her hand, and especially not to
put any near her eyes. This was carried out for some time, but one day,
as she was dressing the baby, her eyes happened to itch, and she rubbed
them with her hand. Then at once she saw a great many wonders she had
not before perceived; and the whole place assumed a new aspect to her.
She said nothing, and in the course of the day she saw a great deal
more. Among other things, she observed small men and small women going
in and out, following a variety of occupations. But their movements
were as light as the morning breeze. To move about was no trouble to
them, and they brought things into the room with the greatest
quickness. They prepared dainty food for the confined lady with the
utmost order and skill, and the air of kindness and affection with
which they served her was truly remarkable. In the evening, as she was
dressing the baby, the midwife said to the lady, &lsquo;You have had a
great many visitors to-day.&rsquo; To this she replied, &lsquo;How do
you know that? Have you been putting the ointment to your eyes?&rsquo;
Thereupon she jumped out of bed, and blew into her eyes, saying,
&lsquo;Now you will see no more.&rsquo; She never afterwards could see
the fairies, however much she tried, nor was the ointment entrusted to
her after that day. According, however, to another version which I
heard, she was told, on being found out, not to apply the ointment to
her eyes any more. She promised she would not; but <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb248" href="#v1pb248" name=
"v1pb248">248</a>]</span>the narrator thought she broke that promise,
as she continued to see the fairies as long as she lived.</p>
<p>Mr. D. &#7930;. Davies has also a version like the North Wales ones.
He obtained it from a woman of seventy-eight at Bronnant, near
Aberystwyth, who had heard it from one of her ancestors. According to
her, the midwife went to the fair called Ffair Rhos, which was held
between Ystrad Meurig and Pont Rhyd Fendigaid<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e7906src" href="#xd26e7906" name="xd26e7906src">21</a>. There she
saw a great many of the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth</i> very busily engaged,
and among others the lady she had been attending upon. That being so,
she walked up to her and saluted her. The fairy lady angrily asked how
she saw her, and spat in her face, which had the result of putting an
end for ever to her power of seeing her or anybody of her race.</p>
<p>The same aged woman at Bronnant has communicated to Mr. D. &#7930;.
Davies another tale which differs from all those of the same kind that
I happen to know of. On a certain day in spring the farmer living at
&mdash;&mdash; (Mr. Davies does not remember the name of the farm) lost
his calves; and the servant man and the servant girl went out to look
for them, but as they were both crossing a marshy flat, the man
suddenly missed the girl. He looked for her, and as he could not see
her he concluded that she was playing a trick on him. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb249" href="#v1pb249" name=
"v1pb249">249</a>]</span>However, after much shouting and searching
about the place, he began to think that she must have found her way
home, so he turned back and asked if the girl had come in, when he
found to his surprise that nobody had seen her come back. The news of
her being lost caused great excitement in the country around, since
many suspected that he had for some reason put an end to her life: some
accounted for it in this way, and some in another. But as nothing could
be found out about her, the servant man was taken into custody on the
charge of having murdered her. He protested with all his heart, and no
evidence could be produced that he had killed the girl. Now, as some
had an idea that she had gone to the fairies, it was resolved to send
to &lsquo;the wise man&rsquo; (<i lang="cy">Y dyn hysbys</i>). This was
done, and he found out that the missing girl was with the fairies: the
trial was delayed, and he gave the servant man directions of the usual
kind as to how to get her out. She was watched at the end of the period
of twelve months and a day coming round in the dance in the fairy ring
at the place where she was lost, and she was successfully drawn out of
the ring; but the servant man had to be there in the same clothes as he
had on when she left him. As soon as she was released and saw the
servant she asked about the calves. On the way home she told her
master, the servant man, and the others, that she would stay with them
until her master should strike her with iron, but they went their way
home in great joy at having found her. One day, however, when her
master was about to start from home, and whilst he was getting the
horse and cart ready, he asked the girl to assist him, which she did
willingly; but as he was bridling the horse, the bit touched the girl
and she disappeared instantly, and was never seen from that day
forth.</p>
<p>I cannot explain this story, unless we regard it as <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb250" href="#v1pb250" name=
"v1pb250">250</a>]</span>made up of pieces of two different stories
which had originally nothing to do with one another; consistency,
however, is not to be expected in such matters. Mr. D. &#7930;. Davies
has kindly given me two more tales like the first part of the one I
have last summarized, also one in which the missing person, a little
boy sent by his mother to fetch some barm for her, comes home of
himself after being away a year or more playing with the <i lang=
"cy">Tylwyth Teg</i>, whom he found to be very nice, pleasant people;
they had been exceedingly kind to him, and they even allowed him to
take the bottle with the barm home at the last. This was somewhere
between Swy&#273; Ffynnon and Carmarthen.</p>
<p>Mr. D. &#7930;. Davies finds, what I have not found anywhere else,
that it was a common idea among the old people in Cardiganshire, that
once you came across one of the fairies you could not easily be rid of
him; since the fairies were little beings of a very devoted nature.
Once a man had become friendly with one of them, the latter would be
present with him almost everywhere he went, until it became a burden to
him. However, popular belief did not adopt this item of faith without
another to neutralize it if necessary: so if one was determined to get
rid of the fairy companion, one had in the last resort only to throw a
piece of rusty iron at him to be quit of him for ever. Nothing was a
greater insult to the fairies. But though they were not difficult to
make friends of, they never forgave those who offended them:
forgiveness was not an element in their nature. The general account my
informant gives of the outward appearance of the fairies as he finds
them in the popular belief, is that they were a small handsome race,
and that their women dressed gorgeously in white, while the men were
content with garments of a dark grey colour, usually including
knee-breeches. As <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb251" href=
"#v1pb251" name="v1pb251">251</a>]</span>might be expected, the
descriptions differ very much in different neighbourhoods, and even in
different tales from the same neighbourhood: this will surprise no one.
It was in the night they came out, generally near water, to sing and
dance, and also to steal whatever took their fancy; for thieving was
always natural to them; but no one ever complained of it, as it was
supposed to bring good luck.</p>

<p>&lsquo;That is a wonderful thing, that old castle there, he would
say, pointing to the Ynys Geinon Rock. I remember a time when people
would be terrified to go near it, especially at night. There was
considerable danger that one might be taken to <i lang="cy">Bendith eu
Mamau</i>. It is said that there are a great many of them there, though
I know not where they abide. The old folks used to say that there was a
pit somewhere about the middle of the Castle, about a yard wide and
some five or six yards deep, with a stone about three tons in weight
over the mouth of it, and that they had a passage underground from that
pit all the way to the cave of Tan yr Ogof, near the top of the Cwm,
that is, near Adelina Patti&rsquo;s residence at Craig y Nos Castle:
there, it was said, they spent their time during the day, while they
came down here to play their tricks at night. They have, they say, a
gold ladder of one or two and twenty rungs, and it is along that they
pass up and down. They have a little word; and it suffices if the
foremost on the ladder merely utters that word, for the stone to rise
of itself; while there is another word, which it suffices the hindmost
in going down to utter so that the stone shuts behind him. It is said
that a servant from one of the neighbouring farms, when looking for
rabbits in the rock, happened to say the word as he stood near the
stone, that it opened for him, and that he went down the ladder; but
that because he was ignorant of the word to make it shut behind him,
the fairies discovered by the draught putting out their candles that
there was something wrong. So they found him out and took him with
them. He remained living with them for seven years, but at the end of
the seven years he escaped with his hat full of guineas. He had by this
time learnt the two words, and got to know a good deal about the hiding
places of their treasures. He told everything to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb255" href="#v1pb255" name=
"v1pb255">255</a>]</span>a farmer in the neighbourhood, so the latter
likewise went down, and some used to say that he brought thence thrice
the fill of a salt-chest of guineas, half-guineas, and
seven-and-sixpenny pieces in one day. But he got too greedy, and like
many a greedy one before him his crime proved his death; for he went
down the fourth time in the dusk of the evening, when the fairies came
upon him, and he was never seen any more. It is said that his four
quarters hang in a room under the Castle; but who has been there to see
them I know not. It is true enough that the above-mentioned farmer got
lost, and that nothing was heard respecting him; and it is equally true
that his family became very well to do almost at once at that time. You
know as well as I do that they say, that the fairies have underground
passages to the caves of Ystradfe&#7931;te, near Penderyn. There is the
Garn Goch also on the Drum (now called On&#7931;wyn); they say there
are hundreds of tons of gold accumulated by them there, and you have
heard the story about one of the Gethings going thither to dig in the
Garn, and how he [<i>sic</i>] was transformed by the fairies into a
wheel of fire, and that he could get no quiet from them until he sent
them to manufacture a rope of sand!&rsquo;&mdash;A more intelligible
version of this story has been given at pp. 19&ndash;20 above.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There was formerly an old woman living in a small house near
Ynys Geinon; and she had the power of bewitching, people used to say:
there was a rumour that she spent seven days, seven hours, and seven
minutes with the fairies every year in the cave at the Castle. It was a
pretty general belief that she got such and such a quantity of gold for
every child she could steal for them, and that she put one of those old
urchins of theirs in its place: the latter never grew at all. The way
she used to do it was to enter people&rsquo;s houses <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb256" href="#v1pb256" name=

large dark-grey old cloak on her back, and the cloak concealed one of
the children of <i lang="cy">Bendith eu Mamau</i>. Whenever she found
the little child of the good woman of the house in its cradle, she
would take upon herself to rock the cradle, so that if the mother only
turned her back for a minute or two, she would throw the sham child
into the cradle and hurry away as fast as she could with the baby. A
man in the neighbourhood had a child lingering for years without
growing at all, and it was the opinion of all that it had been changed
by the old woman. The father at length threatened to call in the aid of
&ldquo;the wise man,&rdquo; when the old woman came there for seven
days, pretending that it was in order to bathe the little boy in cold
water; and on the seventh day she got permission to take him, before it
was light, under a certain spout of water: so she said, but the
neighbours said it was to change him. However that was, the boy from
that time forth got on as fast as a gosling. But the mother had all but
to take an oath to the old woman, that she would duck him in cold water
every morning for three months, and by the end of that time there was
no finer infant in the Cwm.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Davies has given me some account also of the annual pilgrimage
to the Fan mountains to see the Lake Lady: these are his words on the
subject&mdash;they recall pp. 15&ndash;16 above:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It has been the yearly custom (for generations, as far as I
can find) for young as well as many people further advanced in years to
make a general excursion in carts, gambos, and all kinds of vehicles,
to &#7930;yn y Fan, in order to see the water nymph (who appeared on
one day only, viz. the first Sunday in August). This nymph was said to
have the lower part of her body resembling that of a dolphin, while the
upper part was that of a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb257" href=
"#v1pb257" name="v1pb257">257</a>]</span>beautiful lady: this anomalous
form appeared on the first Sunday in August (if the lake should be
without a ripple) and combed her tresses on the reflecting surface of
the lake. The yearly peregrination to the abode of the Fan deity is
still kept up in this valley&mdash;Cwmtaw&euml;; but not to the extent
that it used to formerly.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="first">Mr. Craigfryn Hughes has sent me another tale about
the fairies: it has to do with the parish of &#7930;anfabon, near the
eastern border of Glamorganshire. Many traditions cluster round the
church of &#7930;anfabon, beginning with its supposed building by Saint
Mabon, but which of the Mabons of Welsh legend he was, is not very
certain. Not very far is a place called Pant y Dawns, or the Dance
Hollow, in allusion to the visits paid to the spot by <i lang=
"cy">Bendith y Mamau</i>, as the fairies are there called. In the same
neighbourhood stand also the ruins of Caste&#7931; y Nos, or the Castle
of the Night<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8069src" href="#xd26e8069"
name="xd26e8069src">22</a>, which tradition represents as uninhabitable
because it had been built of stones from &#7930;anfabon Church, and on
account of the ghosts that used to haunt it. However, one small portion
of it was usually tenanted formerly by a &lsquo;wise man&rsquo; or by a
witch. In fact, the whole country round &#7930;anfabon Church teemed
with fairies, ghosts, and all kinds of uncanny creatures:&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;At a farm house still remaining in the parish of
&#7930;anfabon, which is called the Berth Gron, there lived once upon a
time a young widow and her infant child. After losing her husband her
only comfort in her bereavement and solitary state was young Griff, her
son. He was about three years old and a fine child for his age. The
parish was then crammed full of <i lang="cy">Bendith y Mamau</i>, and
when the moon was bright and full they were wont to keep people awake
with their music till the break of day. The fairies of &#7930;anfabon
were remarkable on account of their ugliness, and they were equally
remarkable on account of the tricks they played. Stealing children from
their cradles during the absence of their mothers, and luring men by
means of their music into some pestilential and desolate bog, were
things that seemed to afford them considerable amusement. It was no
wonder then that mothers used to be daily on the watch lest they should
lose their children. The widow alluded to was remarkably careful about
her son, so much so, that it made some of the neighbours say that she
was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb263" href="#v1pb263" name=
"v1pb263">263</a>]</span>too anxious about him and that some misfortune
would overtake her child. But she paid no attention to their words, as
all her joy, her comfort, and her hopes appeared to meet together in
her child. However, one day she heard a moaning voice ascending from
near the cow-house, and lest anything had happened to the cattle, she
ran there in a fright, leaving the door of the house open and her
little son in the cradle. Who can describe her grief on her coming in
and seeing that her son was missing? She searched everywhere for him,
but it was in vain. About sunset, behold a little lad made his
appearance before her and said to her quite distinctly,
&ldquo;Mother.&rdquo; She looked minutely at him, and said at last,
&ldquo;Thou art not my child.&rdquo; &ldquo;I am truly,&rdquo; said the
little one. But the mother did not seem satisfied about it, nor did she
believe it was her child. Something whispered to her constantly, as it
were, that it was not her son. However, he remained with her a whole
year, but he did not seem to grow at all, whereas Griff, her son, was a
very growing child. Besides, the little fellow was getting uglier every
day. At last she resolved to go to the &ldquo;wise man,&rdquo; in order
to have information and light on the matter. There happened then to be
living at Caste&#7931; y Nos, &ldquo;Castle of the Night,&rdquo; a man
who was remarkable for his thorough acquaintance with the secrets of
the evil one. When she had laid her business before him and he had
examined her, he addressed the following remark to her: &ldquo;It is a
<i lang="cy">crimbil</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e8148src" href=
"#xd26e8148" name="xd26e8148src">24</a>, and thy own child is with
those old <i>Bendith</i> somewhere or other: if thou wilt follow my
directions faithfully and minutely thy child will be restored to thee
soon. Now, about noon to-morrow cut an egg through the middle; throw
the one half away from thee, but keep the other in thy hand, and
proceed to mix it backwards and forwards. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb264" href="#v1pb264" name="v1pb264">264</a>]</span>See that the
little fellow be present paying attention to what thou art doing, but
take care not to call his attention to it&mdash;his attention must be
drawn to it without calling to him&mdash;and very probably he will ask
what thou wouldst be doing. Thou art to say that it is mixing a pasty
for the reapers that thou art. Let me know what he will then
say.&rdquo; The woman returned, and on the next day she followed the
cunning man&rsquo;s<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8157src" href=
"#xd26e8157" name="xd26e8157src">25</a> advice to the letter: the
little fellow stood by her and watched her minutely; presently he
asked, &ldquo;Mother, what are you doing?&rdquo; &ldquo;Mixing a pasty
for the reapers, my boy.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, that is it. I heard from my
father&mdash;he had heard it from his father and that one from his
father&mdash;that an acorn was before the oak, and that the oak was in
the earth; but I have neither heard nor seen anybody <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb265" href="#v1pb265" name=
"v1pb265">265</a>]</span>mixing the pasty for the reapers in an
egg-shell.&rdquo; The woman observed that he looked very cross as he
spoke, and that it so added to his ugliness that it made him highly
repulsive.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That afternoon the woman went to the cunning man in order to
inform him of what the dwarf had said. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;he is of that old breed; now the next full moon will be in four
days&mdash;thou must go where the four roads meet above Rhyd y
Gloch<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8273src" href="#xd26e8273" name=
"xd26e8273src">26</a>, at twelve o&rsquo;clock the night the moon is
full. Take care to hide thyself at a spot where thou canst see the ends
of the cross-roads; and shouldst thou see anything that would excite
thee take care to be still and to restrain thyself from giving way to
thy feelings, otherwise the scheme will be frustrated and thou wilt
never have thy son back.&rdquo; The unfortunate mother knew not what to
make of the strange story of the cunning man; she was in the dark as
much as ever. At last the time came, and by the appointed hour she had
concealed herself carefully behind a large bush close by, whence she
could see everything around. She remained there a long time watching;
but nothing was to be seen or heard, while the profound and melancholy
silence of midnight dominated over all. At last she began to hear the
sound of music approaching from afar; nearer and nearer the sweet sound
continued to come, and she listened to it with rapt attention. Ere long
it was close at hand, and she perceived that it was a procession of
<i lang="cy">Bendith y <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb266" href=

other. They were hundreds in point of number, and about the middle of
the procession she beheld a sight that pierced her heart and made the
blood stop in her veins&mdash;walking between four of the <i lang=
"cy">Bendith</i> she saw her own dear little child. She nearly forgot
herself altogether, and was on the point of springing into the midst of
them violently to snatch him from them if she could; but when she was
on the point of leaping out of her hiding place for that purpose, she
thought of the warning of the cunning man, that any disturbance on her
part would frustrate all, so that she would never get her child back.
When the procession had wound itself past, and the sound of the music
had died away in the distance, she issued from her concealment and
directed her steps homewards. Full of longing as she was for her son
before, she was much more so now; and her disgust at the little dwarf
who claimed to be her son had very considerably grown, for she was now
certain in her mind that he was one of the old breed. She knew not how
to endure him for a moment longer under the same roof with her, much
less his addressing her as &ldquo;mother.&rdquo; However, she had
enough restraining grace to behave becomingly towards the ugly little
fellow that was with her in the house. On the morrow she went without
delay to the &ldquo;wise man&rdquo; to relate what she had witnessed
the previous night, and to seek further advice. The cunning man
expected her, and as she entered he perceived by her looks that she had
seen something that had disturbed her. She told him what she had beheld
at the cross-roads, and when he had heard it he opened a big book which
he had; then, after he had long pored over it, he told her, that before
she could get her child back, it was necessary for her to find a black
hen without a single white feather, or one of any other <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb267" href="#v1pb267" name=
"v1pb267">267</a>]</span>colour than black: this she was to place to
bake before a wood<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8291src" href=
"#xd26e8291" name="xd26e8291src">27</a> fire with its feathers and all
intact. Moreover, as soon as she placed it before the fire, she was to
close every hole and passage in the walls except one, and not to look
very intently after the <i lang="cy">crimbil</i> until the hen was done
enough and the feathers had fallen off it every one: then she might
look where he was.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Strange as the advice of the wise man sounded, she resolved
to try it; so she went the next day to search among the hens for one of
the requisite description; but to her disappointment she failed to find
one. She then walked from one farm house to another in her search; but
fortune appeared to scowl at her, as she seemed to fail in her object.
When, however, she was nearly disheartened, she came across the kind of
hen she wanted at a farm at the end of the parish. She bought it, and
after returning home she arranged the fire and killed the hen, which
she placed in front of the bright fire burning on the hearth. Whilst
watching the hen baking she altogether forgot the <i lang=
"cy">crimbil</i>; and she fell into a sort of swoon, when she was
astonished by the sound of music outside the house, similar to the
music she had heard a few nights before at the cross-roads. The
feathers had by this time fallen off the hen, and when she came to look
for the <i lang="cy">crimbil</i> he had disappeared. The mother cast
wild looks about the house, and to her joy she heard the voice of her
lost son calling to her from outside. She ran to meet him, and embraced
him fervently. But when she asked him where he had been so long, he had
no account in the world to give but that he had been listening to
pleasant music. He was very thin and worn in appearance when he was
restored. Such is the story of the Lost Child.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Let me remark as to the urchin&rsquo;s exclamation concerning
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb268" href="#v1pb268" name=
"v1pb268">268</a>]</span>the cooking done in the egg-shell, that Mr.
Hughes, as the result of further inquiry, has given me what he
considers a more correct version; but it is no less inconsequent, as
will be seen:&mdash;</p>

</div>
<p class="first">In Dewi Glan Ffrydlas&rsquo; story from the Ogwen
Valley, in Carnarvonshire, p. 62 above, it is not the cooking of a
pasty but the brewing of beer in an egg-shell. However what is most
remarkable is that the egg-shell is similarly used in stories from
other lands. Mr. Hartland cites one from Mecklenburg and another from
Scandinavia. He also mentions stories in which the imp measures his own
age by the number of forests which he has seen growing successively on
the same soil, the formula being of the following kind: &lsquo;I have
seen the Forest of Ardennes burnt seven times,&rsquo; &lsquo;Seven
times have I seen the wood fall in Less&ouml; Forest,&rsquo; or
&lsquo;I am so old, I was already in the world before the Kamschtschen

<i>that</i> is now laid waste again<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8340src"
href="#xd26e8340" name="xd26e8340src">28</a>.&rsquo; From these and the
like instances it is clear that the Welsh versions here in question are
partially blurred, as the fairy child&rsquo;s words should have been to
the effect that he was old enough to remember the oak when it was yet
but an acorn; and an instance of this explicit kind is given by
Howells&mdash;it comes from &#7930;andrygarn in Anglesey&mdash;see p.
139, where his words run thus: &lsquo;I can remember yon oak an acorn,
but I never saw in my life people brewing in an egg-shell
before.&rsquo; I may add <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb269" href=
"#v1pb269" name="v1pb269">269</a>]</span>that I have been recently
fortunate enough to obtain from Mr. &#7930;ywarch Reynolds another kind
of estimate of the fairy urchin&rsquo;s age. He writes that his mother
remembers a very old Merthyr woman who used to tell the story of the
egg-shell cookery, but in words differing from all the other versions
known to him, thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="first">Before closing this chapter, I wish to touch on the
question of the language of the fairies, though fairy tales hardly ever
raise it, as they usually assume the fairies to speak the same language
as the mortals around them. There is, however, one well-known
exception, namely, the story of Eliodorus, already mentioned, p. 117,
as recorded by Giraldus Cambrensis, who relates how Eliodorus,
preferring at the age of twelve to play the truant to undergoing a
frequent beating by his teacher, fasted two days in hiding in the
hollow of a river bank, and how he was then accosted by two little men
who <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb270" href="#v1pb270" name=
"v1pb270">270</a>]</span>induced him to follow them to a land of sports
and other delights. There he remained long enough to be able, years
later, to give his diocesan, the second Menevian bishop named
David<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8430src" href="#xd26e8430" name=
"xd26e8430src">30</a>, a comprehensive account of the people and realm
of Faery. After Eliodorus had for some time visited and revisited that
land of twilight, his mother desired him to bring her some of the gold
of the fairies. So one day he tried to bring away the gold ball with
which the fairy king&rsquo;s son used to play; but he was not only
unsuccessful, but subjected to indignities also, and prevented from
evermore finding his way back to fairyland. So he had to go again to
school and to the studies which he so detested; but in the course of
time he learned enough to become a priest; and when, stricken in years,
he used to be entreated by Bishop David to relate this part of his
early history, he never could be got to unfold his tale without
shedding tears. Among other things which he said of the fairies&rsquo;
mode of living, he stated that they ate neither flesh nor fish, but
lived for the most part on various kinds of milk food cooked after the
fashion of stirabout, flavoured as it were with saffron<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e8442src" href="#xd26e8442" name=
"xd26e8442src">31</a>. But one of the most curious portions of
Eliodorus&rsquo; yarn was that relating to the language of the fairies;
for he pretended to have learnt it and to have found it to resemble his
own <i lang="la">Britannica Lingua</i>, &lsquo;<i lang=
"cy">Brythoneg</i>, or Welsh.&rsquo; In the words instanced Giraldus
perceived a similarity to Greek<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8455src"
href="#xd26e8455" name="xd26e8455src">32</a>, which he accounted
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb271" href="#v1pb271" name=
"v1pb271">271</a>]</span>for by means of the fabulous origin of the
Welsh from the Trojans and the supposed sojourn made in Greece by those
erring Trojans on their way to Britain. Giraldus displays quite a
pretty interest in comparative philology, and talks glibly of the
<i lang="la">Lingua Britannica</i>; but one never feels certain that he
knew very much more about it than the author of the <i lang=
"la">Germania</i>, the first to refer to it under that name. Tacitus,
however, had the excuse that he lived at a distance and some eleven
centuries before the advent of Gerald the Welshman.</p>
<p>Giraldus&rsquo; words prove, on close examination, to be of no help
to us on the question of language; but on the other hand I have but
recently begun looking out for stories bearing on it. It is my
impression that such are not plentiful; but I proceed to subjoin an
abstract of a phantom funeral tale in point from <i lang=
"cy">Yst&ecirc;n Sioned</i> (Aberystwyth, 1882), pp. 8&ndash;16.
<i lang="cy">Yst&ecirc;n Sioned</i>, I ought to explain, consists of a
number of stories collected and edited in Welsh by the Rev. Chancellor
Silvan Evans, though he has not attached his name to it:&mdash;The
harvest of 1816 was one of the wettest ever known in Wales, and a man
and his wife who lived on a small farm in one of the largest parishes
in the Hundred of Moe&#273;in (see p. 245 above) in the Demetian part
of Cardiganshire went out in the evening of a day which had been
comparatively dry to make some reaped corn into sheaves, as it had long
been down. It was a beautiful night, with the harvest moon shining
brightly, and the field in which they worked had the parish road
passing along one of its sides, without a hedge or a ditch to separate
it from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb272" href="#v1pb272" name=
"v1pb272">272</a>]</span>the corn. When they had been busily at work
binding sheaves for half an hour or more, they happened to hear the hum
of voices, as if of a crowd of people coming along the road leading
into the field. They stopped a moment, and looking in the direction
whence the sounds came, they saw in the light of the moon a number of
people coming into sight and advancing in their direction. They bent
<span class="corr" id="xd26e8529" title="Source: them">then</span>
again to their work without thinking much about what they had seen and
heard; for they fancied it was some belated people making for the
village, which was about a mile off. But the hum and confused sounds
went on increasing, and when the two binders looked up again, they
beheld a large crowd of people almost opposite and not far from them.
As they continued looking on they beheld quite clearly a coffin on a
bier carried on the shoulders of men, who were relieved by others in
turns, as usual in funeral processions in the country. &lsquo;Here is a
funeral,&rsquo; said the binders to one another, forgetting for the
moment that it was not usual for funerals to be seen at night. They
continued looking on till the crowd was right opposite them, and some
of them did not keep to the road, but walked over the corn alongside of
the bulk of the procession. The two binders heard the talk and
whispering, the noise and hum as if of so many real men and women
passing by, but they did not understand a word that was said: not a
syllable could they comprehend, not a face could they recognize. They
kept looking at the procession till it went out of sight on the way
leading towards the parish church. They saw no more of them, and now
they began to feel uneasy and went home leaving the corn alone as it
was; but further on the funeral was met by a tailor at a point in the
road where it was narrow and bounded by a fence (<i lang=
"cy">claw&#273;</i>) on either side. The procession filled the road
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb273" href="#v1pb273" name=
"v1pb273">273</a>]</span>from hedge to hedge, and the tailor tried to
force his way through it, but such was the pressure of the throng that
he was obliged to get out of their way by crossing the hedge. He also
failed to understand a word of the talk which he heard. In about three
weeks after this sham funeral<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8538src" href=
"#xd26e8538" name="xd26e8538src">33</a>, there came a real one down
that way from the upper end of the parish.</p>
<p>Such, in brief, is the story so charmingly told by Silvan Evans,
which he got from the mouths of the farmer and his wife, whom he
considered highly honest and truthful persons, as well as comparatively
free from superstition. The last time they talked to him about the
incident they were very advanced in years, and both died within a few
weeks of one another early in the year 1852. Their remains, he adds,
lie in the churchyard towards which they had seen the <i lang=
"cy">toeli</i> slowly making its way. For <i lang="cy">toeli</i> is the
phonetic spelling in <i lang="cy">Yst&ecirc;n Sioned</i> of the word
which is <i lang="cy">teulu</i> in North Cardiganshire and in North
Wales, for Old Welsh <i lang="cy">toulu</i>. The word now means
&lsquo;family,&rsquo; though literally it should mean
&lsquo;house-army&rsquo; or &lsquo;house-troops,&rsquo; and it is
practically a synonym for <i lang="cy">tylwyth</i>, &lsquo;family or
household,&rsquo; literally &lsquo;house-tribe.&rsquo; Now the <i lang=
"cy">toeli</i> or <i lang="cy">toulu</i> is such an important
institution in Demetian Cardiganshire and some parts of Dyfed proper,
that the word has been confined to the phantom, and for the word family
in its ordinary significations one has there to have recourse to the
non-dialect form <i lang="cy">teulu</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e8585src" href="#xd26e8585" name="xd26e8585src">34</a>. In North
Cardiganshire and North Wales the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb274" href="#v1pb274" name="v1pb274">274</a>]</span><i lang=
"cy">toeli</i> is called simply a <i lang="cy">cla&#273;edigaeth</i>,
&lsquo;burial,&rsquo; or <i lang="cy">angla&#273;</i>,
&lsquo;funeral&rsquo;; in the latter also <i lang="cy">cynhebrwng</i>
is a funeral. I may add that when I was a child in the neighbourhood of
Ponterwyd, on the upper course of the Rheidol, hardly a year used to
pass without somebody or other meeting a phantom funeral. Sometimes one
got entangled in the procession, and ran the risk of being carried off
one&rsquo;s feet by the throng. There is, however, one serious
difference between our phantom funerals and the Demetian <i lang=
"cy">toeli</i>, namely, that we recognize our neighbours&rsquo; ghosts
as making up the processions, and we have no trouble in understanding
their talk. At this point a question of some difficulty presents itself
as to the <i lang="cy">toeli</i>, namely, what family does it
mean?&mdash;is it the family and friends of the departed on his way to
the grave, or does it mean the family in the sense of <i lang=
"cy">Tylwyth Teg</i>, &lsquo;Fair Family,&rsquo; as applied to the
fairies? I am inclined to the latter view, but I prefer thinking that
the distinction itself does not penetrate very deeply, seeing that a
certain species of the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i>, or fairies, may,
in point of origin, be regarded as deceased friends and ancestors of
the <i lang="cy">tylwyth</i>, in the ordinary sense of the word. In
fact all this kind of rehearsal of events seems to have been once
looked at as friendly to the men and women whom it concerned. This will
be seen, for instance, in the Demetian account of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb275" href="#v1pb275" name=
"v1pb275">275</a>]</span><i lang="cy">canwy&#7931; gorff</i>, or corpse
candle, as granted through the intercession of St. David to the people
of his special care, as a means of warning each to get ready in time
for his death; that is to say, to prevent death finding him unprepared.
It is hard to guess why it was assumed that the <i lang=
"cy">canwy&#7931; gorff</i> was unknown in other parts of Wales. One or
two instances in point occur in Owen&rsquo;s <i>Welsh Folklore</i>, pp.
298&ndash;301; and I have myself heard of them being seen in Anglesey,
while they were quite well known to members of Mrs. Rhys&rsquo;
mother&rsquo;s family, who lived in the parish of Waen Fawr, in the
neighbourhood of Carnarvon. Nor does it appear that phantom funerals
were at all confined to South Wales. Proof to the contrary is supplied
to some extent in Owen&rsquo;s <i>Folklore</i>, p. 301; but there is no
doubt that in recent times the belief in them, as well as in the
<i lang="cy">canwy&#7931; gorff</i>, has been more general and more
vivid in South Wales than in North Wales, especially Gwyne&#273;.</p>
<p>I have not been fortunate enough to come across anything systematic
or comprehensive on the origin and meaning of ghostly rehearsals like
the Welsh phantom funeral or coffin making. But the subject is an
interesting one which deserves the attention of our leading folklore
philosophers, as does also the cognate one of second sight, by which it
is widely overlapped.</p>
<p>Quite recently&mdash;at the end of 1899 in fact&mdash;I received
three brief stories, for which I am indebted to the further kindness of
Alaw &#7930;eyn (p. 228), who lives at Bynhadlog near Edern in
&#7930;eyn, and two out of the three touch on the question of language.
But as the three belong to one and the same district, I give the
substance of all in English as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) There were at a small harbour belonging to Nefyn some houses in
which several families formerly lived; the houses are there still, but
nobody lives in them now. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb276" href=
"#v1pb276" name="v1pb276">276</a>]</span>There was one family there to
which a little girl belonged: they used to lose her for hours every
day; so her mother was very angry with her for being so much away.
&lsquo;I must know,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;where you go for your
play.&rsquo; The girl answered that it was to Pin y Wig, &lsquo;The Wig
Point,&rsquo; which meant a place to the west of the Nefyn headland: it
was there, she said, she played with many children. &lsquo;Whose
children?&rsquo; asked the mother. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo;
she replied; &lsquo;they are very nice children, much nicer than I
am.&rsquo; &lsquo;I must know whose children they are,&rsquo; was the
reply; and one day the mother went with her little girl to see the
children: it was a distance of about a quarter of a mile to Pin y Wig,
and after climbing the slope and walking a little along the top they
came in sight of the Pin. It is from this Pin that the people of Pen yr
A&#7931;t got water, and it is from there they get it still. Now after
coming near the Pin the little girl raised her hands with joy at the
sight of the children. &lsquo;O mother,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;their
father is with them to-day: he is not with them always, it is only
sometimes that he is.&rsquo; The mother asked the child where she saw
them. &lsquo;There they are, mother, running down to the Pin, with
their father sitting down.&rsquo; &lsquo;I see nobody, my child,&rsquo;
was the reply, and great fear came upon the mother: she took hold of
the child&rsquo;s hand in terror, and it came to her mind at once that
they were the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i>. Never afterwards was the
little girl allowed to go to Pin y Wig: the mother had heard that the
<i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i> exchanged people&rsquo;s children.</p>
<p>Such is the first story, and it is only remarkable, perhaps, for its
allusion to the father of the fairy children.</p>
<p>(2) There used to be at Edern an old woman who occupied a small farm
called Glan y Gors: the same family lives there still. One day this old
woman had gone to a fair at Criccieth, whence she returned through
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb277" href="#v1pb277" name=
"v1pb277">277</a>]</span>Pw&#7931;heli. As she was getting above Gors
Geirch, which was then a turbary and a pretty considerable bog, a noise
reached her ears: she stopped and heard the sound of much talking.
By-and-by she beheld a great crowd of men and women coming to meet her.
She became afraid and stepped across the fence to let them go by. There
she remained a while listening to their chatter, and when she thought
that they had gone far enough she returned to the road and began to
resume her way home. But before she had gone many steps she heard the
same sort of noise again, and saw again the same sort of crowd coming;
so she recrossed the fence in great fear, saying to herself,
&lsquo;Here I shall be all night!&rsquo; She remained there till they
also had gone, and she wondered what they could be, and whether they
were people who had been to visit Plas Madrun&mdash;afterwards, on
inquiry, she found that no such people had been there that day. Now the
old woman was near enough to the passers-by to hear them talking
(<i lang="cy">clebran</i>) and chattering (<i lang="cy">bregliach</i>),
but not a word could she understand of what they uttered: it was not
Welsh and she did not think that it was English&mdash;it is, however,
not supposed that she knew English. She related further that the last
crowd shouted all together to the other crowd in advance of them
<i lang="cy">Wi</i>, and that the latter replied <i lang="cy">Wi
Wei</i> or something like that.</p>
<p>This account Alaw &#7930;eyn has got, he says, from a
great-granddaughter of the old woman, and she heard it all from her
father, Bar&#273; &#7930;echog, who always had faith in the fairies,
and believed that they will come again to be seen of men and women. For
he thought that they had their periods, a belief which I have come
across elsewhere, and more especially in Carnarvonshire<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e8693src" href="#xd26e8693" name=
"xd26e8693src">35</a>. Now what are we to make of such a story? I
recollect <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb278" href="#v1pb278" name=
"v1pb278">278</a>]</span>reading somewhere of a phantom wedding in
Scotland, but in Wales we seem to have nothing more closely resembling
this than a phantom funeral. Nevertheless what the old woman of Glan y
Gors thought she saw looks by no means unlike a Welsh wedding marching
on foot, especially when, as I have seen done, one party
tried&mdash;seemingly in good earnest&mdash;to escape the other and to
take the bride away from it. Moreover, that the figures making up the
two crowds in her story are to be regarded as fairies is rendered
probable by the next story, which describes the phantoms therein
expressly as little men and little women.</p>
<p>(3) The small farm of Perth y Celyn in Edern used to be held by an
old man named Griffith Griffiths. In his best days he stood six foot,
and he has left behind him a double reputation for bodily strength and
great piety. My informant can well remember him walking to chapel with
the aid of his two sticks. The story goes that one day, when he was in
his prime, he set out from Perth y Celyn at two in the morning to walk
to Carnarvon to pay his rent: there was no talk in those days of a
carriage for anybody. After passing through Nefyn and Pisty&#7931;, he
came in due time to Bwlch Trwyn Swncwl<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e8700src" href="#xd26e8700" name="xd26e8700src">36</a>: he writes
this name also Bwlch Drws Wncwl, with the suggestion that it ought to
be Bwlch Drws Encil, and that the place must have been of importance in
the wars of the ancient Kymry. The high-road, he goes on to say, runs
through the Bwlch, and as Griffith was entering this gap what should he
hear but a great deal of talking. He stopped and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb279" href="#v1pb279" name=
"v1pb279">279</a>]</span>listened, when to his surprise he saw coming
towards him, devoid of all fear, a crowd of little men and little
women. They talked aloud, but he could not understand a single word
they said: he thought that it was neither Welsh nor English. They
passed by him on the road, but he moved aside to the ditch lest they
should knock against him; but no feeling of fear came upon him. The old
man believed them to have been the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i>.</p>
<p>In the story of the Moe&#273;in funeral the language of the <i lang=
"cy">toeli</i> was not intelligible to the farmer and his wife, or to
the tailor, and here in two stories from &#7930;eyn we have it clearly
stated that it was neither Welsh nor, probably, English. Since the
fairies are always represented as old-fashioned in their ways, it is
quite possible that they were once regarded as talking a more ancient
language of the country. Which was it? An early version of these
legends might perhaps have supplied the answer, and told us that it was
<i lang="cy">Gwy&#273;elig</i> or Goidelic, if not an earlier idiom, to
wit that of the Aborigines before they learnt Goidelic from the Celts
of the first wave of Aryan invasion, whether it was in the region of
the Eifl or in the Demetian half of Keredigion. As to the former it is
worthy of note that when Griffith had reached Bwlch Trwyn Swncwl he was
in the outskirts of the Eifl Mountains, on one of whose heights, not
very far off, is the extensive prehistoric fortress of Tre&rsquo;r
Ceiri, or the Town of the Keiri, a vocable which may be provisionally
rendered by &lsquo;giants.&rsquo; In any case it dissociates that
stronghold from the Brythonic people of Wales. We shall find, however,
that a Goidel, or Pict, buried in a cairn on Snowdon, is known as Rhita
<i lang="cy">Gawr</i>, &lsquo;Rhita the Giant&rsquo;; and it is
possible that in the Keiri of <i lang="cy">Tre&rsquo;r Ceiri</i> we
have no other race than that of mixed Goidels and Picts whom the
encroaching Brythons <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb280" href=
"#v1pb280" name="v1pb280">280</a>]</span>found in possession of the
west of our island. Nay, one may say that this is rendered probable by
the use made of the word <i lang="cy">ceiri</i> in medieval Welsh: thus
in some poetry composed by a certain Dafy&#273; Offeiriad, and copied
by Thomas Williams of Trefriw, we have a line alluding to Britain in
the words:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>Coron ynys y Ce&ucirc;ri</i><a class="noteref" id=

</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">The Crown of the Giants&rsquo; Island.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">Here <i lang="cy">Ynys y Ce&ucirc;ri</i> inevitably
recalls the fact that Britain is called <i lang="cy">Ynys y Kedyrn</i>,
or Island of the Mighty, in the <i>Mabinogion</i>, and also, in effect,
in the story of Kulhwch and Olwen. But such stories as these, which
enabled Geoffrey to say, i. 16, when he introduced his banal brood of
Trojans, that up to that time Britain had only been inhabited by a few
giants, are the legends, as will be pointed out later, of the
Brythonicized Goidels of Wales. So one may infer that their ancestors
had given this country the name of the Island of the Mighty, unless it
should prove more accurate to suppose them to have somehow derived the
term from the Aborigines.</p>
<p>This last surmise is countenanced by the fact that in the Kulhwch
story, the British Isles as a group are called Islands of the Mighty.
The words are <i lang="cy">Teir ynys y kedyrn ae their rac ynys</i>;
that is, the Three Islands of the Mighty and their Three outpost
Islands. That is not all, for in the same story the designation is
varied thus: <i lang="cy">Teir ynys prydein ae their rac
ynys</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e8799src" href="#xd26e8799" name=
"xd26e8799src">38</a>, or <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb281" href=
"#v1pb281" name="v1pb281">281</a>]</span>Prydain&rsquo;s Three Islands
and Prydain&rsquo;s Three outpost Islands; and the substantial
antiquity of the designation &lsquo;the Islands of Prydain,&rsquo; is
proved by its virtual identity with that used by ancient Greek authors
like Ptolemy, who calls both Britain and Ireland a <span class="trans"
title="n&#275;sos Pretanik&#275;"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&nu;&#8134;&sigma;&omicron;&sigmaf;
&Pi;&rho;&epsilon;&tau;&alpha;&nu;&iota;&kappa;&#8053;</span></span>,
where <i>Pretanic</i> and <i>Prydain</i> are closely related words. Now
our <i>Prydain</i> had in medieval Welsh the two forms <i>Prydein</i>
and <i>Prydyn</i>. But some time or other there set in a tendency to
desynonymize them, so as to make <i>Ynys Prydein</i>, &lsquo;the
Picts&rsquo; Island,&rsquo; mean Great Britain, and <i lang=
"cy">Prydyn</i> mean the Pictland of the North. But just as <i lang=
"cy">Cymry</i> meant the plural Welshmen <i>and</i> the singular Wales,
so <i lang="cy">Prydyn</i> meant Picts<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e8852src" href="#xd26e8852" name="xd26e8852src">39</a> <i>and</i>
the country of the Picts. Now the plural <i lang="cy">Prydyn</i> has
its etymological Goidelic equivalent in the vocable <i lang=
"cy">Cruithni</i>, which is well known to have meant the Picts or the
descendants of the <i lang="la">Picti</i> of Roman historians. Further,
this last name cannot be severed from that of the <i lang=
"la">Pictones</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e8889src" href="#xd26e8889"
name="xd26e8889src">40</a> in Gaul, and it is usually supposed to have
referred to their habit of tattooing themselves. At all events this
agrees with the apparent meaning of the names <i lang="cy">Prydyn</i>
and <i lang="cy">Cruithni</i>, from <i lang="cy">pryd</i> and <i lang=
"cy">cruth</i>, the words in Welsh and Irish respectively for
<i>form</i> or <i>shape</i>, the designation being supposed to refer to
the forms or pictures of various animals punctured on the skins of the
Picts. So much as to the practical identity of the terms <i lang=
"cy">Prydyn</i>, <i lang="cy">Cruithni</i>, and the Greeks&rsquo;
<i>Pretanic</i>; but how could <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb282"
href="#v1pb282" name="v1pb282">282</a>]</span><i>Cedyrn</i> and
<i>Prydein</i> correspond in the terms <i>Ynys y Kedyrn</i> and <i>Ynys
Prydein</i>? This one is enabled to understand by means of
<i>ce&ucirc;ri</i> or <i>ceiri</i> as a middle term. Now <i>cadarn</i>
means strong or valiant, and makes the plural <i>cedyrn</i>; but there
is another Welsh word <i>cadr</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e8955src"
href="#xd26e8955" name="xd26e8955src">41</a> which has also the meaning
of valiant or powerful, and may have yielded some such a medieval form
as <i>ceidyr</i> in the plural. Now this <i>cadr</i> is proved by its
cognates<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9071src" href="#xd26e9071" name=
"xd26e9071src">42</a> not to have always had the meaning of valiant or
strong: its original signification was more nearly &lsquo;fine,
beautiful, or beautified.&rsquo; Thus what seems to have happened is,
that <i>cadarn</i>, &lsquo;strong, powerful, mighty,&rsquo; influenced
the meaning of <i>cadr</i>, &lsquo;beautiful,&rsquo; and eventually
usurped its place in the name of the island, which from being <i lang=
"cy">Ynys y Ceidyr</i> became <i lang="cy">Ynys y Cedyrn</i>. But the
former meant the &lsquo;Island of the fine or beautiful men,&rsquo;
which was closely enough the meaning also of the words Prydain,
Cruithni, and Picts, as names of a people who delighted to beautify
their persons by tattooing their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb283"
href="#v1pb283" name="v1pb283">283</a>]</span>skins and making
themselves <i>distingu&eacute;</i> in that savage fashion. That is not
all, for on examination it turns out that the word <i>ceiri</i>, which
has been treated up to this point as meaning giants, is but a double,
so to say, of the word <i>cadr</i> in the plural, both as to etymology
and original meaning of beautiful. It is a word in constant use in
Carnarvonshire, where it is ironically applied to pretentious men fond
of showing themselves off, especially in the matter of clothes.
<i>&rsquo;D ydi nhw &rsquo;n geiri!</i> &lsquo;Aren&rsquo;t they
swells!&rsquo; <i>Dyna i ch&rsquo;i gawr!</i> &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a
fine fellow for you!&rsquo; and so also with the feminine
<i>cawres</i>. Of course the <i>cawr</i> of standard Welsh is familiar
enough in the sense of giant to Carnarvonshire people, so the meaning
can be best ascertained in the case of the plural <i>ceiri</i>, which
they hardly ever meet with in print; and, so far as I have been able to
ascertain, by <i>ceiri</i> they mean&mdash;in an ironical sense it is
true&mdash;fine fellows, with reference not to great stature or
strength but to their get-up. Thus one arrives at the true
interpretation of the name <i>Tre&rsquo;r Ceiri</i> as the Town of the
<i>Prydyn</i> or <i>Cruithni</i>; that is to say, the Town of the Picts
or the Aborigines, who showed themselves off decorated with pictures.
So far also from <i>Ynys y Ceiri</i> being an echo of <i>Ynys y
Cedyrn</i>, it turns out to be really the more original of the two.
Such names, when they are closely examined, are apt to prove old beyond
all hastily formed expectation. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb284"

excessive fondness for our Arthur English people translate this name
into Arthur&rsquo;s Seat instead of Idris&rsquo; Seat; but Idris was
also somebody: he was a giant with a liking for the study of the stars.
But let that be: I wish to say a word concerning his name: Idris may be
explained as meaning &lsquo;War-champion,&rsquo; or the like; and,
phonologically speaking, it comes from <i lang="cy">Iu&#273;-rys</i>,
which was made successively into <i lang="cy">Id-rys</i>, <i>Idris</i>.
The syllable <i lang="cy">i&#813;u&#273;</i> meant battle or fight, and
it undergoes a variety of forms in Welsh names. Thus before <i>n</i>,
<i>r</i>, <i>l</i>, and <i>w</i>, it becomes <i>id</i>, as in
<i>Idnerth</i>, <i>Idloes</i>, and <i>Idwal</i>, while <i lang=
"cy">Iu&#273;-hael</i> yields <i>Ithel</i>, whence Ab Ithel, anglicized
<i>Bethel</i>. At the end, however, it is <i lang="cy">y&#273;</i> or
<i>u&#273;</i>, as in <i lang="cy">Gruffu&#273;</i> or <i lang=
"cy">Gruffy&#273;</i>, from Old Welsh <i lang=
"cy">Grippi&#813;u&#273;</i>, and <i lang="cy">Maredu&#273;</i> or
<i lang="cy">Meredy&#273;</i> for an older <i lang=
"cy">Marget-i&#813;u&#273;</i>. By itself it is possibly the word which
the poets write <i lang="cy">u&#273;</i>, and understand to mean
<i>lord</i>; but if these forms are related, it must have originally
meant rather a fighter, soldier, or champion.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow"

<i lang="cy">Cwta</i> makes <i>cota</i> in the feminine in North
Cardiganshire; the word is nevertheless only the English <i>cutty</i>
borrowed. <i>Du</i>, &lsquo;black,&rsquo; has corresponding to it in
Irish, <i lang="ga">dubh</i>. So the Welsh word seems to have passed
through the stages <i>dyv</i>, <i>dyw</i>, before <i>yw</i> was
contracted into <i>&ucirc;</i>, which was formerly pronounced like
French <i>&ucirc;</i>, as proved by the grammar already mentioned (p.
22) of J. D. Rhys, published in London in 1592; see p. 33, to which my
attention has been called by Prof. J. Morris Jones. In Old or
pre-Norman Welsh <i>m</i> did duty for <i>m</i> and <i>v</i>, so one
detects <i>dyv</i> as <i>dim</i> in a woman&rsquo;s name
<i>Penardim</i>, &lsquo;she of the very black head&rsquo;; there was
also a <i>Penarwen</i>, &lsquo;she of the very blonde head.&rsquo; The
look of <i>Penardim</i> having baffled the redactor of the
<i>Branwen</i>, he left the spelling unchanged: see the (Oxford)
<i>Mabinogion</i>, p. 26. The same sort of change which produced
<i>du</i> has produced <i>cnu</i>, &lsquo;a fleece,&rsquo; as compared
with <i>cneifio</i>, &lsquo;to fleece&rsquo;; <i lang=
"cy">&#7931;uarth</i>, &lsquo;a kitchen garden,&rsquo; as compared with

<i lang="cy">Rhiwa&#7931;on</i>, occurring sometimes as <i lang=

phonetic process is exemplified by the verbal nouns ending in <i>u</i>,
such as <i lang="cy">caru</i>, &lsquo;to love,&rsquo; <i lang=
"cy">credu</i>, &lsquo;to believe,&rsquo; <i lang="cy">tyngu</i>,

pronunciation continues to be <i lang="cy">prynh&aacute;wn</i> or
<i lang="cy">pyrnh&aacute;wn</i>, sometimes reduced in Gwyne&#273; to
<i lang="cy">pnawn</i>. Let me add an instance which has reached me
since writing the above: In the <i lang="la">Arch&aelig;ologia
Cambrensis</i> for 1899, pp. 325&ndash;6, we have the pedigree of the
<i>Ameridiths</i> from the Visitation of Devonshire in 1620: in the
course of it one finds that Iuan ap Merydeth has a son Thomas
<i>Amerideth</i>, who, knowing probably no Welsh, took to writing his
patronymic more nearly as it was pronounced. The line is brought down
to Ames <i>Amerideth</i>, who was created baronet in 1639.
<i>Amerideth</i> of course = Ap Meredy&#273;, and the present member of
the family who writes to the <i lang="la">Arch&aelig;ologia
Cambrensis</i> spells his patronymic more correctly, <i>Ameridith</i>;
but if it had survived in Wales it might have been
<i>Amheredy&#273;</i>. For an older instance than any of these see the
<i>Book of Taliessin</i>, poem xlix (= Skene, ii. 204), where one reads
of <i lang="cy">Beli Amhanogan</i>, &lsquo;B. ab
Mynogan.&rsquo;&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

<i>informed</i> on matters which are dark to others; but the word is
also used of facts&mdash;<i lang="cy">Y mae &rsquo;r peth yn

divisible into <i lang="cy">hy-spys</i>, which would be in Irish, had
it existed in the language, <i lang="cy">so-scese</i> for an early
<i lang="cy">su-squesti&#813;a-s</i>, the related Irish words being

<i lang="cy">ci</i> and <i>ces</i> have been equated by Zimmer with the
Sanskrit verb <i>caksh</i>, &lsquo;to see,&rsquo; from a root
<i>quas</i>. The adjective <i lang="cy">cynnil</i> applied to the
<i lang="cy">dyn hyspys</i> in Glamorgan means now, as a rule,
&lsquo;economical&rsquo; or &lsquo;thrifty,&rsquo; but in this instance
it would seem to have signified &lsquo;shrewd,&rsquo;
&lsquo;cunning,&rsquo; or &lsquo;clever,&rsquo; though it would
probably come nearer the original meaning of the word to render it by
&lsquo;smart,&rsquo; for it is in Irish <i lang="ga">conduail</i>,
which is found applied to ingenious work, such as the ornamentation on
the hilt of a sword. Another term for a wizard or conjurer is <i lang=
"cy">gwr cyfarwy&#273;</i>, with which the reader is already familiar.
Here <i lang="cy">cyfarwy&#273;</i> forms a link with the <i lang=
"cy">kyvar&#7933;yd</i> of the <i>Mabinogion</i>, where it usually
means a professional man, especially one skilled in story and history;
and what constituted his knowledge was called <i lang=
"cy">kyvar&#7933;ydyt</i>, which included, among other things,
acquaintance with boundaries and pedigrees, but it meant most
frequently perhaps story; see the (Oxford) <i>Mabinogion</i>, pp. 5,
61, 72, 93. All these terms should, strictly speaking, have <i lang=
"cy">gwr</i>&mdash;<i lang="cy">gwr hyspys</i>, <i lang="cy">gwr
cynnil</i>, and <i lang="cy">gwr cyfarwy&#273;</i>&mdash;but for the
fact that modern Welsh tends to restrict <i lang="cy">gwr</i> to
signify &lsquo;a husband&rsquo; or &lsquo;a married man,&rsquo; while
<i lang="cy">dyn</i>, which only signifies a <i>mortal</i>, is made to
mean man, and provided with a feminine <i lang="cy">dynes</i>,
&lsquo;woman,&rsquo; unknown to good Welsh literature. Thus the spoken
language is in this matter nearly on a level with English and French,

<i>Cadarn</i> and <i>cadr</i> postulate respectively some such early
forms as <i>cat&#7771;no-s</i> and <i>cadro-s</i>, which according to
analogy should become <i>cadarn</i> and <i>ca&#273;r</i>. Welsh,
however, is not fond of <i>&#273;r</i>; so here begins a bifurcation:
(1) retaining the <i>d</i> unchanged <i>cadro-s</i> yields <i>cadr</i>,
or (2) <i>dr</i> is made into <i>&#273;r</i>, and other changes set in
resulting in the <i>ceir</i> of <i>ceiri</i>, as in Welsh
<i>aneirif</i>, &lsquo;numberless,&rsquo; from <i>eirif</i>,
&lsquo;number,&rsquo; of the same origin as Irish <i>&aacute;ram</i>
from *<i>a&#273;-rim</i> = *<i>ad-r&#299;m&#257;</i>, and Welsh
<i>eiliw</i>, &lsquo;<i>species</i>, colour,&rsquo; for
<i>a&#273;-liw</i>, in both of which <i>i</i> follows <i>&#273;</i>
combinations; but that is not essential, as shown by <i>cader</i>,
<i>cadair</i>, for Old Welsh <i>cateir</i>, &lsquo;a chair,&rsquo; from
Latin <i>cat[h]edra</i>. The word that serves as our singular, namely
<i>cawr</i>, is far harder to explain; but on the whole I am inclined
to regard it as of a different origin, to wit, the Goidelic word
<i>caur</i>, &lsquo;a giant or hero,&rsquo; borrowed. The plural
<i>cewri</i> or <i>cawri</i> is formed from the singular <i>cawr</i>,
which means a giant, though, associated in the plural with

<p class="first">The following paper exhausts no part of the subject:
it simply embodies the substance of my notes of conversations which I
have had with Manx men and Manx women, whose names, together with such
other particulars as I could get, are in my possession. I have mostly
avoided reading up the subject in printed books; but those who wish to
see it exhaustively treated may be directed to Mr. Arthur W.
Moore&rsquo;s book on <i>The Folklore of the Isle of Man</i>, to which
may now be added Mr. C. Roeder&rsquo;s <i>Contributions to the Folklore
of the Isle of Man</i> in the <i>Lioar Manninagh</i> for 1897, pp.
129&ndash;91.</p>
<p>For the student of folklore the Isle of Man is very fairly stocked
with inhabitants of the imaginary order. She has her fairies and her
giants, her mermen and brownies, her kelpies and water-bulls.</p>
<p>The water-bull or <i>tarroo ushtey</i>, as he is called in Manx, is
a creature about which I have not been able to learn much, but he is
described as a sort of bull disporting himself about the pools and
swamps. For instance, I was told at the village of Andreas, in the flat
country forming the northern end of the island, and known as
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb285" href="#v1pb285" name=
"v1pb285">285</a>]</span>the Ayre, that there used to be a <i>tarroo
ushtey</i> between Andreas and the sea to the west: it was before the
ground had been drained as it is now. And an octogenarian captain at
Peel related to me how he had once when a boy heard a <i>tarroo
ushtey</i>: the bellowings of the brute made the ground tremble, but
otherwise the captain was unable to give me any very intelligible
description. This bull is by no means of the same breed as the bull
that comes out of the lakes of Wales to mix with the farmers&rsquo;
cattle, for there the result used to be great fertility among the
stock, and an overflow of milk and dairy produce, but in the Isle of
Man the <i>tarroo ushtey</i> only begets monsters and strangely formed
beasts.</p>
<p>The kelpie, or, rather, what I take to be a kelpie, was called by my
informants a <i>glashtyn</i>; and Kelly, in his <i>Manx Dictionary</i>,
describes the object meant as &lsquo;a goblin, an imaginary animal
which rises out of the water.&rsquo; One or two of my informants
confused the glashtyn with the Manx brownie. On the other hand, one of
them was very definite in his belief that it had nothing human about
it, but was a sort of grey colt, frequenting the banks of lakes at
night, and never seen except at night.</p>
<p>Mermen and mermaids disport themselves on the coasts of Man, but I
have to confess that I have made no careful inquiry into what is
related about them; and my information about the giants of the island
is equally scanty. To confess the truth, I do not recollect hearing of
more than one giant, but that <i>was</i> a giant: I have seen the marks
of his huge hands impressed on the top of two massive monoliths. They
stand in a field at Balla Keeill Pherick, on the way down from the Sloc
to Colby. I was told there were originally five of these stones
standing in a circle, all of them marked in the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb286" href="#v1pb286" name=
"v1pb286">286</a>]</span>same way by the same giant as he hurled them
down there from where he stood, miles away on the top of the mountain
called Cronk yn Irree Laa. Here I may mention that the Manx word for a
giant is <i>foawr</i>, in which a vowel-flanked <i>m</i> has been
spirited away, as shown by the modern Irish spelling, <i>fomhor</i>.
This, in the plural in old Irish, appears as the name of the
<i>Fomori</i>, so well known in Irish legend, which, however, does not
always represent them as giants, but rather as monsters. I have been in
the habit of explaining the word as meaning <i>submarini</i>; but no
more are they invariably connected with the sea. So another etymology
recommends itself, namely, one which comes from Dr. Whitley Stokes, and
makes the <i>mor</i> in <i>fomori</i> to be of the same origin as the
<i>mare</i> in the English night<i>mare</i>, French cauche<i>mar</i>,
German <i>mahr</i>, &lsquo;an elf,&rsquo; and cognate words. I may
mention that with the Fomori of mythic origin have doubtless been
confounded and identified certain invaders of Ireland, especially the
Dumnonians from the country between Galloway and the mouth of the
Clyde, some of whom may be inferred to have coasted the north of
Ireland and landed in the west, for example in Erris, the north-west of
Mayo, called after them <i>Irrus</i> (or Erris) <i>Domnann</i>.</p>
<p id="v1ch4.1">The Manx brownie is called the <i>fenodyree</i>, and he
is described as a hairy and apparently clumsy fellow, who would, for
instance, thrash a whole barnful of corn in a single night for the
people to whom he felt well disposed; and once on a time he undertook
to bring down for the farmer his wethers from Snaefell. When the
fenodyree had safely put them in an outhouse, he said that he had some
trouble with the little ram, as it had run three times round Snaefell
that morning. The farmer did not quite understand him, but on going to
look at the sheep, he found, to his infinite surprise, that
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb287" href="#v1pb287" name=
"v1pb287">287</a>]</span>the little ram was no other than a hare,
which, poor creature, was dying of fright and fatigue. I need scarcely
point out the similarity between this and the story of Peredur, who, as
a boy, drove home two hinds with his mother&rsquo;s goats from the
forest: he owned to having had some trouble with the goats that had so
long run wild as to have lost their horns, a circumstance which had
greatly impressed him<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9278src" href=
"#xd26e9278" name="xd26e9278src">1</a>. To return to the fenodyree, I
am not sure that there were more than one in Man&mdash;I have never
heard him spoken of in the plural; but two localities at least are
assigned to him, namely, a farm called Ballachrink, in Colby, in the
south, and a farm called Lanjaghan, in the parish of Conchan, near
Douglas. Much the same stories, however, appear to be current about him
in the two places, and one of the most curious of them is that which
relates how he left. The farmer so valued the services of the
fenodyree, that one day he took it into his head to provide clothing
for him. The fenodyree examined each article carefully, and expressed
his idea of it, and specified the kind of disease it was calculated to
produce. In a word, he found that the clothes would make head and foot
sick, and he departed in disgust, saying to the farmer, &lsquo;Though
this place is thine, the great glen of Rushen is not.&rsquo; Glen
Rushen is one of the most retired glens in the island, and it drains
down through Glen Meay to the coast, some miles to the south of Peel.
It is to Glen Rushen, then, that the fenodyree is supposed to be gone;
but on visiting that valley in 1890<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9290src"
href="#xd26e9290" name="xd26e9290src">2</a> in quest of Manx-speaking
peasants, I could find nobody there who knew anything of him. I suspect
that the spread <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb288" href="#v1pb288"
name="v1pb288">288</a>]</span>of the English language even there has
forced him to leave the island altogether. Lastly, with regard to the
term <i>fenodyree</i>, I may mention that it is the word used in the
Manx Bible of 1819 for <i>satyr</i> in Isaiah xxxiv. 14<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e9302src" href="#xd26e9302" name=
"xd26e9302src">3</a>, where we read in the English Bible as follows:
&lsquo;The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild
beasts of the island, and the satyr shall cry to his fellow.&rsquo; In
the Vulgate the latter clause reads: <i lang="la">et pilosus clamabit
alter ad alterum</i>. The term <i>fenodyree</i> has been explained by
Cregeen in his <i>Manx Dictionary</i> to mean one who has hair for
stockings or hose. That answers to the description of the hairy satyr,
and seems fairly well to satisfy the phonetics of the case, the words
from which he derives the compound being <i>fynney</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e9329src" href="#xd26e9329" name=
"xd26e9329src">4</a>, &lsquo;hair,&rsquo; and <i>oashyr</i>, &lsquo;a
stocking&rsquo;; but as <i>oashyr</i> seems to come from the old Norse
<i>hosur</i>, the plural of <i>hosa</i>, &lsquo;<i>hose</i> or
stocking,&rsquo; the term <i>fenodyree</i> cannot date before the
coming of the Norsemen; and I am inclined to think the idea more
Teutonic than Celtic. At any rate I need not point out to the English
reader the counterparts of this hairy satyr in the hobgoblin &lsquo;Lob
lie by the Fire,&rsquo; and Milton&rsquo;s &lsquo;Lubber Fiend,&rsquo;
whom he describes as one that</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Basks at the fire his hairy strength,</p>
<p class="line">And crop-full out of doors he flings,</p>
<p class="line">Ere the first cock his matin rings.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Lastly, I may mention that Mr. Roeder has a great deal
to say about the fenodyree under the name of glashtyn; for it is
difficult to draw any hard and fast <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb289" href="#v1pb289" name="v1pb289">289</a>]</span>line between
the glashtyn and the fenodyree, or even the water-bull, so much alike
do they seem to have been regarded. Mr. Roeder&rsquo;s items of
folklore concerning the glashtyns (see the <i>Lioar Manninagh</i>, iii.
139) show that there were male and female glashtyns, and that the
former were believed to have been too fond of the women at Ballachrink,
until one evening some of the men, dressed as women, arranged to
receive some youthful glashtyns. Whether the fenodyree is of Norse
origin or not, the glashtyn is decidedly Celtic, as will be further
shown in chapter vii. Here it will suffice to mention one or two
related words which are recorded in Highland Gaelic, namely,
<i>glaistig</i>, &lsquo;a she-goblin which assumes the form of a
goat,&rsquo; and <i>glaisrig</i>, &lsquo;a female fairy or a goblin,
half human, half beast.&rsquo;</p>
<p id="v1ch4.2">The fairies claim our attention next, and as the only
other fairies tolerably well known to me are those of Wales, I can only
compare or contrast the Manx fairies with the Welsh ones. They are
called in Manx, <i>sleih beggey</i>, or little people, and
<i>ferrishyn</i>, from the English word <i>fairies</i>, as it would
seem. Like the Welsh fairies, they kidnap babies; and I have heard it
related how a woman in Dalby had a struggle with the fairies over her
baby, which they were trying to drag out of the bed from her. Like
Welsh fairies, also, they take possession of the hearth after the
farmer and his family are gone to bed. A man in Dalby used to find them
making a big fire in his kitchen: he would hear the crackling and
burning of the fire when nobody else <i>could</i> have been there
except the fairies and their friends. I said &lsquo;friends,&rsquo; for
they sometimes take a man with them, and allow him to eat with them at
the expense of others. Thus, some men from the northern-most parish,
Kirk Bride, went once on a time to Port Erin, in the south, to buy a
supply of fish for the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb290" href=
"#v1pb290" name="v1pb290">290</a>]</span>winter, and with them went a
Kirk Michael man who had the reputation of being a <i>persona grata</i>
to the fairies. Now one of the Port Erin men asked a man from the north
who the Michael man might be: he was curious to know his name, as he
had seen him once before, and on that occasion the Michael man was with
the fairies at his house&mdash;the Port Erin man&rsquo;s
house&mdash;helping himself to bread and cheese in company with the
rest. As the fairies were regaling themselves in this instance on
ordinary bread and cheese at a living Manxman&rsquo;s expense, the
story may perhaps be regarded as not inconsistent with one mentioned by
Cumming<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9423src" href="#xd26e9423" name=
"xd26e9423src">5</a> to the following effect:&mdash;A man attracted one
night as he was crossing the mountains, by fairy music, entered a fairy
hall where a banquet was going on. He noticed among them several faces
which he seemed to know, but no act of mutual recognition took place
till he had some drink offered him, when one of those whom he seemed to
know warned him not to taste of the drink if he had any wish to make
his way home again. If he partook of it he would become like one of
them. So he found an opportunity for spilling it on the ground and
securing the cup; whereupon the hall and all its inmates
instantaneously vanished. On this I may remark that it appears to have
been a widely spread belief, that no one who had partaken of the food
for spirits would be allowed to return to his former life, and some
instances will be found mentioned by Professor Tylor in his
<i>Primitive Culture</i>, ii. 50&ndash;2.</p>
<p>Like the Welsh fairies, the Manx ones take men away with them and
detain them for years. Thus a Kirk Andreas man was absent from his
people for four years, which he spent with the fairies. He could not
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb291" href="#v1pb291" name=
"v1pb291">291</a>]</span>tell how he returned, but it seemed as if,
having been unconscious, he woke up at last in this world. The other
world, however, in which he was for the four years was not far away, as
he could see what his brothers and the rest of the family were doing
every day, although they could not see him. To prove this, he mentioned
to them how they were occupied on such and such a day, and, among other
things, how they took their corn on a particular day to Ramsey. He
reminded them also of their having heard a sudden sharp crack as they
were passing by a thorn bush he named, and how they were so startled
that one of them would have run back home. He asked them if they
remembered that, and they said they did, only too well. He then
explained to them the meaning of the noise, namely, that one of the
fairies with whom he had been galloping the whole time was about to let
fly an arrow at his brothers, but that as he was going to do this, he
(the missing brother) raised a plate and intercepted the arrow: that
was the sharp noise they had heard. Such was the account he had to give
of his sojourn in Faery. This representation of the world of the
fairies, as contained within the ordinary world of mortals, is very
remarkable; but it is not a new idea, as we seem to detect it in the
Irish story of the abduction of Conla R&uacute;ad<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e9439src" href="#xd26e9439" name="xd26e9439src">6</a>: the fairy
who comes to fetch him tells him that the folk of Tethra, whom she
represents, behold him every day as he takes part in the assemblies of
his country and sits among his friends. The commoner way of putting it
is simply to represent the fairies as invisible to mortals at will; and
one kind of Welsh story relates how the mortal midwife accidentally
touches her eyes, while dressing a fairy baby, with an ointment which
makes the fairy world visible to her: see pp. 63, 213, above.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb292" href="#v1pb292" name=
"v1pb292">292</a>]</span></p>
<p>Like Welsh fairies, the Manx ones had, as the reader will have seen,
horses to ride; they had also dogs, just as the Welsh ones had. This I
learn from another story, to the effect that a fisherman, taking a
fresh fish home, was pursued by a pack of fairy dogs, so that it was
only with great trouble he reached his own door. Then he picked up a
stone and threw it at the dogs, which at once disappeared; but he did
not escape, as he was shot by the fairies, and so hurt that he lay ill
for fully six months from that day. He would have been left alone by
the fairies, I was told, if he had only taken care to put a pinch of
salt in the fish&rsquo;s mouth before setting out, for the Manx fairies
cannot stand salt or baptism. So children that have been baptized are,
as in Wales, less liable to be kidnapped by these elves than those that
have not. I scarcely need add that a twig of <i>cuirn</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e9450src" href="#xd26e9450" name="xd26e9450src">7</a>
or rowan is also as effective against fairies in Man as it is in Wales.
Manx fairies seem to have been musical, like their kinsmen elsewhere;
for I have heard of an Orrisdale man crossing the neighbouring
mountains at night and hearing fairy music, which took his fancy so
much that he listened, and tried to remember it. He had, however, to
return, it is said, three times to the place before he could carry it
away complete in his mind, which he succeeded in doing at <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb293" href="#v1pb293" name=
"v1pb293">293</a>]</span>last just as the day was breaking and the
musicians disappearing. This air, I am told, is now known by the name
of the <i>Bollan Bane</i>, or White Wort. As to certain Welsh airs
similarly supposed to have been derived from the fairies, see pages
201&ndash;2 above.</p>
<p>So far I have pointed out next to nothing but similarities between
Manx fairies and Welsh ones, and I find very little indicative of a
difference. First, with regard to salt, I am unable to say anything in
this direction, as I do not happen to know how Welsh fairies regard
salt: it is not improbable that they eschew salt as well as baptism,
especially as the Church of Rome has long associated salt with baptism.
There is, however, one point, at least, of difference between the
fairies of Man and of Wales: the latter are, so far as I can call to
mind, never supposed to discharge arrows at men or women, or to handle
a bow<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9507src" href="#xd26e9507" name=
"xd26e9507src">8</a> at all, whereas Manx fairies are always ready to
shoot. May we, therefore, provisionally regard this trait of the Manx
fairies as derived from a Teutonic source? At any rate English and
Scotch elves were supposed to shoot, and I am indebted to the kindness
of my colleague, Professor Napier, for calling my attention to the
<i>Leechdoms of Early England</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e9512src"
href="#xd26e9512" name="xd26e9512src">9</a> for cases in point.</p>
<p id="v1ch4.3">Now that most of the imaginary inhabitants of Man and
its coasts have been rapidly passed in review before the reader, I may
say something of others whom I regard as semi-imaginary&mdash;real
human beings to whom impossible attributes are ascribed: I mean chiefly
the witches, or, as they are sometimes called in Manx <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb294" href="#v1pb294" name=
"v1pb294">294</a>]</span>English, <i>butches</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e9521src" href="#xd26e9521" name="xd26e9521src">10</a>. That term
I take to be a variant of the English word <i>witch</i>, produced under
the influence of the verb <i>bewitch</i>, which was reduced in Manx
English to a form <i>butch</i>, especially if one bear in mind the
Cumbrian and Scottish pronunciation of these words, as <i>wutch</i> and
<i>bewutch</i>. Now witches shift their form, and I have heard of one
old witch changing herself into a pigeon; but that I am bound to regard
as exceptional, the regular form into which Manx witches pass at their
pleasure being that of the hare, and such a swift and thick skinned
hare that no greyhound, except a black one without a single white hair,
can catch it, and no shot, except a silver coin, penetrate its body.
Both these peculiarities are also well known in Wales. I notice a
difference, however, between Wales and Man with regard to the hare
witches: in Wales only the women can become hares, and this property
runs, so far as I know, in certain families. I have known many such,
and my own nurse belonged to one of them, so that my mother was
reckoned to be rather reckless in entrusting me to <i>y Gota</i>, or
&lsquo;the Cutty One,&rsquo; as she might run away at any moment,
leaving her charge to take care of itself. But I have never heard of
any man or boy of any such family turning himself into a hare, whereas
in the Isle of Man the hare witches may belong, if I may say so, to
either sex. I am not sure, however, that a man who turns himself into a
hare would be called a wizard or witch; and I recollect hearing in the
neighbourhood of Ramsey of a man nicknamed the <i>gaaue mwaagh</i>,
that is to say, &lsquo;the hare smith,&rsquo; the reason being that
this particular smith now and then assumed the form of a hare. I am not
quite sure that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb295" href="#v1pb295"
name="v1pb295">295</a>]</span><i>gaaue mwaagh</i> is the name of a
class, though I rather infer that it is. If so, it must be regarded as
a survival of the magic skill associated with smiths in ancient
Ireland, as evidenced, for instance, in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Hymn in the
eleventh or twelfth century manuscript at Trinity College, Dublin,
known as the <i>Liber Hymnorum</i>, in which we have a
prayer&mdash;</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="first">The persons who had the power of turning themselves
into hares were believed to be abroad and very active, together with
the whole demon world, on the eve of May-day of the Old Style. And a
middle-aged man from the parish of Andreas related to me how he came
three or four times across a woman reputed to be a witch, carrying on
her evil practices at the junction of cross-roads, or the meeting of
three boundaries. This happened once very early on Old May morning, and
afterwards he met her several times as he was returning home from
visiting his sweetheart. He warned the witch that if he found her again
he would kick her: that is what he tells me. Well, after a while he did
surprise her again at work at four cross-roads, somewhere near Lezayre.
She had a circle, he said, as large as that made by horses in
threshing, swept clean around her. He kicked her and took away her
besom, which he hid till the middle of the day. Then he made the farm
boys fetch some dry gorse, and he put the witch&rsquo;s besom on the
top of it. Thereupon fire was set to the gorse, and, wonderful to
relate, the besom, as it burned, crackled and made reports like guns
going off. In fact, the noise could be heard at Andreas
Church&mdash;that is to say, miles away. The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb296" href="#v1pb296" name=
"v1pb296">296</a>]</span>besom had on it &lsquo;seventeen sorts of
knots,&rsquo; he stated, and the woman herself ought to have been
burned: in fact, he added that she did not long survive her besom. The
man who related this to me is hale and strong, living now in the parish
of Michael, and not in that of Andreas, where he was born.</p>
<p id="v1ch4.4">There is a tradition at St. John&rsquo;s, which is
overlooked by the mountain called Slieau Whallian, that witches used at
one time to be punished by being set to roll down the steep side of the
mountain in spiked barrels; but, short of putting them to death, there
were various ways of rendering the machinations of witches innocuous,
or of undoing the mischief done by them; for the charmers supply
various means of meeting them triumphantly, and in case an animal is
the victim, the burning of it always proves an effective means of
bringing the offender to book: I shall have occasion to return to this
under another heading. There is a belief that if you can draw blood,
however little, from a witch, or one who has the evil eye, he loses his
power of harming you; and I have been told that formerly this belief
was sometimes acted upon. Thus, on leaving church, for instance, the
man who fancied himself in danger from another would sidle up to him or
walk by his side, and inflict on him a slight scratch, or some other
trivial wound, which elicited blood; but this must have been a course
always attended with more or less danger.</p>
<p>The persons able to undo the witches&rsquo; work, and remove the
malignant influence of the evil eye, are known in Manx English as
charmers, and something must now be said of them. They have various
ways of proceeding to their work. A lady of about thirty-five, living
at Peel, related to me how, when she was a child suffering from a
swelling in the neck, she had it charmed <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb297" href="#v1pb297" name="v1pb297">297</a>]</span>away by an old
woman. This charmer brought with her no less than nine pieces of iron,
consisting of bits of old pokers, old nails, and other odds and ends of
the same metal, making in all nine pieces. After invoking the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Ghost, she began to rub the girl&rsquo;s neck
with the old irons; nor was she satisfied with that, for she rubbed the
doors, the walls, and the furniture likewise, with the metal. The
result, I was assured, was highly satisfactory, as she has never been
troubled with a swelling in the throat since that day. Sometimes a
passage from the Bible is made use of in charming, as, for instance, in
the case of bleeding. One of the verses then pronounced is Ezekiel xvi.
6, which runs thus:&mdash;&lsquo;And when I passed by thee, and saw
thee polluted in thine own blood, I said unto thee when thou wast in
thy blood, Live; yea, I said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood,
Live.&rsquo; This was told me by a Laxey man, who is over seventy years
of age. The methods of charming away warts are various. A woman from
the neighbourhood of St. John&rsquo;s explained to me how a charmer
told her to get rid of the warts on her hands. She was to take a string
and make a knot on it for every wart she had, and then tie the string
round her hand, or fingers&mdash;I forget which; and I think my
informant, on her part, forgot to tell me a vital part of the formula,
namely, that the string was to be destroyed. But however that may be,
she assured me that the warts disappeared, and have never returned
since. A lady at Andreas has a still simpler method of getting rid of
warts. She rubs a snail on the warts, and then places the snail on one
of the points of a blackthorn, and, in fact, leaves the snail to die,
transfixed by the thorn; and as the snail dies the warts disappear. She
has done this in the case of her niece with complete success, so far as
the wart was concerned; but <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb298"
href="#v1pb298" name="v1pb298">298</a>]</span>she had forgotten to
notice whether the snail had also succumbed.</p>
<p>The lady who in this case applied the remedy cannot be in any sense
called a charmer, however much one may insist on calling what she did a
charm. In fact, the term charmer tends to be associated with a
particular class of charm involving the use of herbs. Thus there used
to be at one time a famous charmer living near Kirk Michael, to whom
the fishermen were in the habit of resorting, and my informant told me
that he had been deputed more than once by his fellow fishermen to go
to him in consequence of their lack of success in the fishing. The
charmer gave him a packet of herbs, cut small, with directions that
they should be boiled, and the water mixed with some spirits&mdash;rum,
I think&mdash;and partly drunk in the boat by the captain and the crew,
and partly sprinkled over the boat and everything in it. The charmer
clearly defined his position in the matter to my informant. &lsquo;I
cannot,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;put the fish in your nets for you; but
if there is any mischief in the way of your luck, I can remove that for
you.&rsquo; The fishermen themselves had, however, more exaggerated
notions of the charmer&rsquo;s functions, for once on a time my
informant spent on drink for his boon companions the money which he was
to give the charmer, and then he collected herbs himself&mdash;it did
not much matter what herbs&mdash;and took them to his captain, who,
with the crew, went through the proper ritual, and made a most
successful haul that night. In fact, the only source of discontent was
the charmer&rsquo;s not having distributed the fish over two nights,
instead of endangering their nets by an excessive haul all in one
night. They regarded him as able to do almost anything he liked in the
matter.</p>
<p>A lady at Andreas gave me an account of a celebrated <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb299" href="#v1pb299" name=
"v1pb299">299</a>]</span>charmer who lived between there and the coast.
He worked on her husband&rsquo;s farm, but used to be frequently called
away to be consulted. He usually cut up wormwood for the people who
came to him, and if there was none to be had, he did not scruple to rob
the garden of any small sprouts it contained of cabbage or the like. He
would chop them small, and give directions about boiling them and
drinking the water. He usually charged any one leaving him to speak to
nobody on the way, lest he break the charm, and this mysteriousness was
evidently an important element in his profession. But he was,
nevertheless, a thriftless fellow, and when he went to Peel, and sent
the crier round to announce his arrival, and received a good deal of
money from the fishermen, he seldom so conducted himself as to bring
much of his earnings home. He died miserably some seven or eight years
ago at Ramsey, and left a widow in great poverty. As to the present
day, the daughter of a charmer now dead is married to a man living in a
village on the southern side of the island, and she appears to have
inherited her father&rsquo;s reputation for charming, as the fishermen
from all parts are said to flock to her for luck. Incidentally, I have
heard in the south more than once of her being consulted in cases of
sudden and dangerous illness, even after the best medical advice has
been obtained: in fact, she seems to have a considerable practice.</p>
<p>In answer to my question, how the charmer who died at Ramsey used to
give the sailors luck in the fishing, my informant at Andreas could not
say, except that he gave them herbs as already described, and she
thought also that he sold them wisps to place under their pillows. I
gather that the charms were chiefly directed to the removal of supposed
impediments to success in the fishing, rather than to any act of a more
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb300" href="#v1pb300" name=
"v1pb300">300</a>]</span>positive nature. So far as I have been able to
ascertain, charming is hereditary, and they say that it descends from
father to daughter, and then from daughter to son, and so on&mdash;a
remarkable kind of descent, on which I should be glad to learn the
opinion of anthropologists. One of the best Manx scholars in the island
related to me how some fishermen once insisted on his doing the charmer
for them because of his being of such and such a family, and how he
made fools of them. It is my impression that the charming families are
comparatively few in number, and this looks as if they descended from
the family physicians or druids of one or two chieftains in ancient
times. It is very likely a question which could be cleared up by a
local man familiar with the island and all that tradition has to say on
the subject of Manx pedigrees.</p>
<p>In the case of animals ailing, the herbs were also resorted to; and,
if the beasts happened to be milch cows, the herbs had to be boiled in
some of their milk. This was supposed to produce wonderful results,
described as follows by a man living at a place on the way from
Castletown up South Barrule:&mdash;A farmer in his parish had a cow
that milked blood, as he described it, and this in consequence of a
witch&rsquo;s ill-will. He went to the charmer, who gave him some
herbs, which he was to boil in the ailing cow&rsquo;s milk, and the
charmer charged him, whatever he did, not to quit the concoction while
it was on the fire, in spite of any noises he might hear. The farmer
went home and proceeded that night to boil the herbs as directed, but
he suddenly heard a violent tapping at the door, a terrible lowing of
the cattle in the cow-house, and stones coming down the
&lsquo;chumley&rsquo;: the end of it was that he suddenly fled and
sprang into bed to take shelter behind his wife. He went to the charmer
again, and related to him what <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb301"
href="#v1pb301" name="v1pb301">301</a>]</span>had happened: he was told
that he must have more courage the next time, unless he wished his cow
to die. He promised to do his best, and this time he stood his ground
in spite of the noises and the creaking of the windows&mdash;until, in
fact, a back window burst into pieces and bodily let a witch in, who
craved his pardon, and promised nevermore to molest him or his. This
all happened at the farm in question in the time of the present
farmer&rsquo;s grandfather. The boiling of the charmer&rsquo;s herbs in
milk always produces a great commotion and lowing among the cattle, and
it invariably cures the ailing ones: this is firmly believed by
respectable farmers whom I could name, in the north of the island in
particular, and I am alluding to men whom one might consider fairly
educated members of their class.</p>
<p id="v1ch4.5">In the last mentioned instance not only is the
requisite cure effected, but the witch who caused the mischief is
brought on the spot. I have recently heard of a parallel to this in a
belief which appears to be still prevalent in the Channel Islands, more
especially Guernsey. The following incidents have been communicated to
me by an ardent folklorist, who has friends in the islands:&mdash;</p>
<p>An old woman in Torteval became ill, and her two sons were told that
if they tried one of the charms of divination, such as boiling certain
weeds in a pot, the first person to come to the house would prove to be
the one who had cast a spell over their mother. Accordingly they made
their <i>bouillederie</i>, and who should come to the door but a poor,
unoffending Breton onion seller, and as he was going away he was
waylaid by the two sons, who beat him within an inch of his life. They
were prosecuted and sentenced to terms of imprisonment; but the
charming did not come out in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb302"
href="#v1pb302" name="v1pb302">302</a>]</span>evidence, though it was
generally known to have been the reason for the assault. This account
was given my informant in 1898, and the incident appears to have
happened not very long before. Another is related thus:&mdash;A certain
family suffered from a plague of lice, which they regarded as the
consequence of a spell. They accordingly made their boiling of herbs
and looked for the first comer. He turned out to be a neighbour of
theirs who wished to buy some turnip seeds. The family abused him
roundly. He went away, but he was watched and caught by two of the sons
of the house, who beat him cruelly. They, on being prosecuted, had to
pay him &pound;5 damages. This took place in the summer of 1898, in the
narrator&rsquo;s own parish, in Guernsey. I have also another case of
recent date, to the effect that a young woman, whose churning was so
unsuccessful that the butter would not come, boiled herbs in the
prescribed way. She awaited the first comer, and, being engaged, her
intended husband was not unnaturally the first to arrive. She abused
him so unsparingly that he broke off the engagement. These instances go
far enough to raise the question why the boiling of herbs should be
supposed to bring the culprit immediately on the spot, but they hardly
go any further, namely, to help us to answer it.</p>
<p id="v1ch4.6">Magic takes us back to a very primitive and loose
manner of thinking; so the marvellously easy way in which it identifies
any tie of association, however flimsy, with the insoluble bond of
relationship which educated men and women regard as connecting cause
and effect, renders even simpler means than I have described quite
equal to the undoing of the evils resulting from the activity of the
evil eye. Thus, let us suppose that a person endowed with the evil eye
has just passed by the farmer&rsquo;s herd of cattle, and a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb303" href="#v1pb303" name=
"v1pb303">303</a>]</span>calf has suddenly been seized with a serious
illness, the farmer hurries after the man of the evil eye to get the
dust from under his feet. If he objects, the farmer may, as has
sometimes been actually done, throw him down by force, take off his
shoes, and scrape off the dust adhering to their soles, and carry it
back to throw over the calf. Even that is not always necessary, as it
appears to be quite enough if he takes up dust where he of the evil eye
has just trod the ground. There are innumerable cases on folk-record of
both means proving entirely efficacious, and they remind one of a story
related in the <i lang="la">Itinerarium Kambri&aelig;</i>, i. 11, by
Giraldus, as to the archbishop when he was preaching in the
neighbourhood of Haverfordwest. A certain woman had lost her sight, but
had so much faith in that holy man that she sent her son to try and
procure the least bit of the fringe of his clothing. The youth, unable
to make his way through the crowd that surrounded the preacher, waited
till it dispersed, and then took home to his mother the sod on which he
had stood and on which his feet had left their mark. That earth was
applied by her to her face and eyes, with the result that she at once
recovered her sight. A similar question of psychology presents itself
in a practice intended as a preservative against the evil eye rather
than as a cure. I allude to what I have heard about two maiden ladies
living in a Manx village which I know very well: they are natives of a
neighbouring parish, and I am assured that whenever a stranger enters
their house they proceed, as soon as he goes away, to strew a little
dust or sand over the spot where he stood. That is understood to
prevent any malignant influence resulting from his visit. This tacit
identifying of a man with his footprints may be detected in a more
precarious and pleasing form in a quaint conceit <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb304" href="#v1pb304" name=
"v1pb304">304</a>]</span>familiar to me in the lyrics of rustic life in
Wales, when, for example, a coy maiden leaves her lovesick swain hotly
avowing his perfect readiness to <i>cusanu ol ei thraed</i>, that is,
to do on his knees all the stages of her path across the meadow,
kissing the ground wherever it has been honoured with the tread of her
dainty foot. Let me take another case, in which the cord of association
is not so inconceivably slender, namely, when two or more persons
standing in a close relation to one another are mistakenly treated a
little too much as if mutually independent, the objection is heard that
it matters not whether it is A or B, that it is, in fact, all the same,
as they belong to the same concern. In Welsh this is sometimes
expressed by saying, <i>Yr un yw Huw&rsquo;r Glyn a&rsquo;i glocs</i>,
that is, &lsquo;Hugh of the Glen and his clogs are all one.&rsquo;
Then, when you speak in English of a man &lsquo;standing in
another&rsquo;s shoes,&rsquo; I am by no means certain, that you are
not employing an expression which meant something more to those who
first used it than it does to us. Our modern idioms, with all their
straining after the abstract, are but primitive man&rsquo;s mental
tools adapted to the requirements of civilized life, and they often
retain traces of the form and shape which the neolithic worker&rsquo;s
chipping and polishing gave them.</p>
<p id="v1ch4.7">It is difficult to arrange these scraps under any
clearly classified headings, and now that I have led the reader into
the midst of matters magical, perhaps I may just as well go on to the
mention of a few more: I alluded to the boiling of the herbs according
to the charmer&rsquo;s orders, with the result, among other things, of
bringing the witch to the spot. This is, however, not the only instance
of the importance and strange efficacy of fire. For when a beast dies
on a farm, of course it dies, according to the old-fashioned view of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb305" href="#v1pb305" name=
"v1pb305">305</a>]</span>things as I understand it, from the influence
of the evil eye or the interposition of a witch. So if you want to know
to whom you are indebted for the loss of the beast, you have simply to
burn its carcase in the open air and watch who comes first to the spot
or who first passes by: that is the criminal to be charged with the
death of the animal, and he cannot help coming there&mdash;such is the
effect of the fire. A Michael woman, who is now about thirty, related
to me how she watched while the carcase of a bewitched colt was
burning, how she saw the witch coming, and how she remembers her
shrivelled face, with nose and chin in close proximity. According to
another native of Michael, a well informed middle-aged man, the animal
in question was oftenest a calf, and it was wont to be burnt whole,
skin and all. The object, according to him, is invariably to bring the
bewitcher on the spot, and he always comes; but I am not clear what
happens to him when he appears. My informant added, however, that it
was believed that, unless the bewitcher got possession of the heart of
the burning beast, he lost all his power of bewitching. He related,
also, how his father and three other men were once out fishing on the
west coast of the island, when one of the three suddenly expressed his
wish to land. As they were fishing successfully some two or three miles
from the shore, they would not hear of it. He, however, insisted that
they must put him ashore at once, which made his comrades highly
indignant; but they soon had to give way, as they found that he was
determined to leap overboard unless they complied. When he got on shore
they watched him hurrying away towards where a beast was burning in the
corner of a field.</p>
<p id="v1ch4.8">Manx stories merge this burning in a very perplexing
fashion with what may be termed a sacrifice for luck. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb306" href="#v1pb306" name=
"v1pb306">306</a>]</span>The following scraps of information will make
it clear what I mean:&mdash;A respectable farmer from Andreas told me
that he was driving with his wife to the neighbouring parish of Jurby
some years ago, and that on the way they beheld the carcase of a cow or
an ox burning in a field, with a woman engaged in stirring the fire. On
reaching the village to which they were going, they found that the
burning beast belonged to a farmer whom they knew. They were further
told it was no wonder that the said farmer had one of his cattle burnt,
as several of them had recently died. Whether this was a case of
sacrifice or not I cannot say. But let me give another instance: a man
whom I have already mentioned, saw at a farm nearer the centre of the
island a live calf being burnt. The owner bears an English name, but
his family has long been settled in Man. The farmer&rsquo;s explanation
to my informant was that the calf was burnt to secure luck for the rest
of the herd, some of which were threatening to die. My informant
thought there was absolutely nothing the matter with them, except that
they had too little food. Be that as it may, the one calf was
sacrificed as a burnt offering to secure luck for the rest of the
cattle. Let me here also quote Mr. Moore&rsquo;s note in his <i>Manx
Surnames</i>, p. 184, on the place-name <i>Cabbal yn Oural Losht</i>,
or the &lsquo;Chapel of the Burnt Sacrifice.&rsquo; &lsquo;This
name,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;records a circumstance which took place in
the nineteenth century, but which, it is to be hoped, was never
customary in the Isle of Man. A farmer, who had lost a number of his
sheep and cattle by murrain, burned a calf as a propitiatory offering
to the Deity on this spot, where a chapel was afterwards built. Hence
the name.&rsquo; Particulars, I may say, of time, place, and person,
could be easily added to Mr. Moore&rsquo;s statement, excepting,
perhaps, as to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb307" href=
"#v1pb307" name="v1pb307">307</a>]</span>deity in question: on that
point I have never been informed, but Mr. Moore was probably right in
the use of the capital <i>d</i>, as the sacrificer was, according to
all accounts, a devout Christian. I have to thank Sir Frederick Pollock
for calling my attention to a parallel this side of the sea: he refers
me to Worth&rsquo;s <i>History of Devonshire</i> (London, 1886), p.
339, where one reads the following singular
passage:&mdash;&lsquo;Living animals have been burnt alive in sacrifice
within memory to avert the loss of other stock. The burial of three
puppies &ldquo;brandise-wise&rdquo; in a field is supposed to rid it of
weeds.&rsquo; The second statement is very curious, and the first seems
to mean that preventive sacrifices have been performed in Devonshire
within the memory of men living in the author&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>One more Manx instance: an octogenarian woman, born in the parish of
Bride, and now living at Kirk Andreas, saw, when she was a &lsquo;lump
of a girl&rsquo; of ten or fifteen years of age, a live sheep being
burnt in a field in the parish of Andreas, on May-day, whereby she
meant the first of May reckoned according to the Old Style. She
asserts<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9651src" href="#xd26e9651" name=
"xd26e9651src">12</a> very decidedly that it was <i>son oural</i>,
&lsquo;for a sacrifice,&rsquo; as she put it, and &lsquo;for an object
to the public&rsquo;: those were her words when she expressed herself
in English. Further, she made the statement that it was a custom to
burn a sheep on Old May-day for a sacrifice. I was fully alive to the
interest of this evidence, and cross-examined her so far as her age
allows of it, and I find that she adheres to her statement with all
firmness, but I distinguish two or three points in her evidence: 1. I
have no doubt that she saw, as she was passing by a certain field on
the borders of Andreas parish, a live sheep being burnt on <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb308" href="#v1pb308" name=
"v1pb308">308</a>]</span>Old May-day. 2. But her statement that it was
<i>son oural</i>, or as a sacrifice, was probably only an inference
drawn by her, possibly years afterwards, on hearing things of the kind
discussed. 3. Lastly, I am convinced that she did hear the May-day
sacrifice discussed, both in Manx and in English: her words, &lsquo;for
an object to the public,&rsquo; are her imperfect recollection of a
phrase used in her hearing by somebody more ambitious of employing
English abstract terms than she is; and the formal nature of her
statement in Manx, that it was customary on May-day to burn as a
sacrifice one head of sheep (<i lang="gv">Laa Boaldyn va cliaghtey dy
lostey son oural un baagh keyrragh</i>), produces the same impression
on my mind, that she is only repeating somebody else&rsquo;s words. I
mention this more especially as I have failed to find anybody else in
Andreas or Bride, or indeed in the whole island, who will now confess
to having ever heard of the sheep sacrifice on Old May-day.</p>
<p id="v1ch4.9">The time assigned to the sheep sacrifice, namely
May-day, leads me to make some remarks on the importance of that day
among the Celts. The day meant is, as I have already said, Old May-day,
in Manx <i lang="gv">Shenn Laa Boaldyn</i>, the <i>belltaine</i> of
Cormac&rsquo;s <i>Glossary</i>, Scotch Gaelic <i>bealtuinn</i>. This
was a day when systematic efforts were made to protect man and beast
against elves and witches; for it was then that people carried crosses
of rowan in their hats and placed May flowers over the tops of their
doors and elsewhere as preservatives against all malignant influences.
With the same object in view crosses of rowan were likewise fastened to
the tails of the cattle, small crosses which had to be made without the
help of a knife: I exhibited a tiny specimen at one of the meetings of
the Folk-Lore Society. Early on May morning one went out to gather the
dew as a thing of great virtue, as in other <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb309" href="#v1pb309" name=
"v1pb309">309</a>]</span>countries. At Kirk Michael one woman, who had
been out on this errand years ago, told me that she washed her face
with the dew in order to secure luck, a good complexion, and safety
against witches. The break of this day is also the signal for setting
the ling or the gorse on fire, which is done in order to burn out the
witches wont to take the form of the hare; and guns, I am told, were
freely used to shoot any game met with on that morning. With the proper
charge some of the witches were now and then hit and wounded, whereupon
they resumed the human form and remained cripples for the rest of their
lives. Fire, however, appears to have been the chief agency relied on
to clear away the witches and other malignant beings; and I have heard
of this use of fire having been carried so far that a practice was
sometimes observed&mdash;as, for example, in Lezayre&mdash;of burning
gorse, however little, in the hedge of each field on a farm in order to
drive away the witches and secure luck.</p>
<p>The man who told me this, on being asked whether he had ever heard
of cattle being driven through fire or between two fires on May-day,
replied that it was not known to him as a Manx custom, but that it was
an Irish one. A cattle-dealer whom he named used on May-day to drive
his cattle through fire so as to singe them a little, as he believed
that would preserve them from harm. He was an Irishman, who came to the
island for many years, and whose children are settled in the island
now. On my asking him if he knew whence the dealer came, he answered,
&lsquo;From the mountains over there,&rsquo; pointing to the Mourne
Mountains looming faintly in the mists on the western horizon. The
Irish custom known to my Manx informant is interesting both as throwing
light on the Manx custom, and as being the continuation of a very
ancient rite <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb310" href="#v1pb310"
name="v1pb310">310</a>]</span>mentioned by Cormac. That writer, or
somebody in his name, says that <i>belltaine</i>, May-day, was so
called from the &lsquo;lucky fire,&rsquo; or the &lsquo;two
fires,&rsquo; which the druids of Erin used to make on that day with
great incantations; and cattle, he adds, used to be brought to those
fires, or to be driven between them, as a safeguard against the
diseases of the year. Cormac<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9688src" href=
"#xd26e9688" name="xd26e9688src">13</a> says nothing, it will be
noticed, as to one of the cattle or the sheep being sacrificed for the
sake of prosperity to the rest. However, Scottish<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e9691src" href="#xd26e9691" name="xd26e9691src">14</a> May-day
customs point to a sacrifice having been once usual, and that possibly
of human beings, and not of sheep as in the Isle of Man. I have
elsewhere<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9709src" href="#xd26e9709" name=
"xd26e9709src">15</a> tried to equate these Celtic May-day practices
with the Thargelia<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9716src" href=
"#xd26e9716" name="xd26e9716src">16</a> of the Athenians of antiquity.
The Thargelia were characterized by peculiar rites, and among other
things then done, two adult persons were led about, as it were
scapegoats, and at the end they were sacrificed and burnt, so that
their ashes might be dispersed. Here we seem to be on the track of a
very ancient Aryan practice, although the Celtic season does not quite
coincide with the Greek one. Several items of importance for comparison
here will be found passed under careful review in a most suggestive
paper by Mr. Lawrence Gomme, &lsquo;On the Method of determining the
Value of Folklore as Ethnological Data,&rsquo; in the Fourth Report of
the Ethnographical Survey Committee<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9725src"
href="#xd26e9725" name="xd26e9725src">17</a>.</p>
<p>It is probably in some ancient May-day custom that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb311" href="#v1pb311" name=
"v1pb311">311</a>]</span>we are to look for the key to a remarkable
place-name occurring several times in the island: I allude to that of
<i>Cronk yn Irree Laa</i>, which probably means the Hill of the Rise of
Day. This is the name of one of the mountains in the south of the
island, but it is also borne by one of the knolls near the eastern end
of the range of low hills ending abruptly on the coast between Ramsey
and Bride parish, and quite a small knoll bears the name, near the
church of Jurby<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9738src" href="#xd26e9738"
name="xd26e9738src">18</a>. I have heard of a fourth instance, which,
as I learn from Mr. Philip Kermode, editor of the <i>Lioar
Manninagh</i>, is on Clay Head, near Laxey. It has been attempted to
explain it as meaning the Hill of the Watch by Day, in reference to the
old institution of Watch and Ward on conspicuous places in the island;
but that explanation is inadmissible as doing violence to the phonetics
of the words in question<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9744src" href=
"#xd26e9744" name="xd26e9744src">19</a>. I am rather inclined to think
that the name everywhere refers to an eminence to which the surrounding
inhabitants resorted for a religious purpose on a particular day in the
year. I should suggest that it was to do homage to the rising sun on
May morning, but this conjecture is offered only to await a better
explanation. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb312" href="#v1pb312"
name="v1pb312">312</a>]</span></p>
<p id="v1ch4.10">The next great day in the pagan calendar of the Celts
is called in Manx <i lang="gv">Laa Lhunys</i>, in Irish
<i>Lugnassad</i>, the assembly or fair, which was associated with the
name of the god Lug. This should correspond to Lammas, but, reckoned as
it is according to the Old Style, it falls on the twelfth of August,
which used to be a great day for business fairs in the Isle of Man as
in Wales. But for holiday making the twelfth only suited when it
happened to be a Sunday: when that was not the case, the first Sunday
after the twelfth was fixed upon. It is known, accordingly, as the
first Sunday of Harvest, and it used to be celebrated by crowds of
people visiting the tops of the mountains. The kind of interference to
which I have alluded with regard to an ancient holiday, is one of the
regular results of the transition from Roman Catholicism to a
Protestant system with only one fixed holiday, namely, Sunday. The same
shifting has partly happened in Wales, where Lammas is <i>Gwyl
Awst</i>, or the festival of Augustus, since the birthday of Augustus,
auspiciously for him and the celebrity of his day, fell in with the
great day of the god Lug in the Celtic world. Now the day for going up
the Fan Fach mountain in Carmarthenshire was Lammas, but under a
Protestant Church it became the first Sunday in August; and even
modified in that way it could not long survive under a vigorous
sabbatarian <i>r&eacute;gime</i> either in Wales or Man. As to the
latter in particular, I have heard it related by persons who were
present, how the crowds on the top of South Barrule on the first Sunday
of Harvest were denounced as pagans by a preacher called William Gick,
some seventy years ago; and how another man called Paric Beg, or Little
Patrick, preaching to the crowds on Snaefell in milder terms, used to
wind up the service with a collection, which appears to have proved a
speedier method <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb313" href="#v1pb313"
name="v1pb313">313</a>]</span>of reducing the dimensions of these
meetings on the mountain tops. Be that as it may, they seem to have
dwindled since then to comparative insignificance.</p>
<p>If you ask the reason for this custom now, for it is not yet quite
extinct, you are told, first, that it is merely to gather ling berries;
but now and then a quasi-religious reason is given, namely, that it is
the day on which Jephthah&rsquo;s daughter went forth to bewail her
virginity &lsquo;upon the mountains&rsquo;: somehow some Manx people
make believe that they are doing likewise. That is not all, for people
who have never themselves thought of going up the mountains on the
first Sunday of harvest or any other, will be found devoutly reading at
home about Jephthah&rsquo;s daughter on that day. I was told this first
in the south by a clergyman&rsquo;s wife, who, finding a woman in the
parish reading the chapter in question on that day, asked the reason
for her fixing on that particular portion of the Bible. She then had
the Manx view of the matter fully explained to her, and she has since
found more information about it, and so have I. It is needless for me
to say that I do not quite understand how Jephthah&rsquo;s daughter
came to be introduced: perhaps it is vain to look for any deeper reason
than that the mention, of the mountains may have served as a sort of
catch-word, and that as the Manx people began to cease from visiting
the tops of the mountains annually, it struck the women as the next
best thing for them to read at home of one who did &lsquo;go up and
down upon the mountains&rsquo;: they are great readers of the Bible
generally. In any case we have here a very curious instance of a
practice, originally pagan, modifying itself profoundly to secure a new
lease of life.</p>
<p>Between May-day and November eve, there was a day of considerable
importance in the island; but the fixing on it was probably due to
influence other than <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb314" href=
"#v1pb314" name="v1pb314">314</a>]</span>Celtic: I mean Midsummer Eve,
or St. John&rsquo;s. However, some practices connected with it would
seem to have been of Celtic origin, such as &lsquo;the bearing of
rushes to certain places called Warrefield and Mame on Midsummer
Even.&rsquo; Warrefield was made in Manx into <i>Barrule</i>, but
<i>Mame</i>, &lsquo;the <i>jugum</i>, or ridge,&rsquo; has not been
identified. The Barrule here in question was South Barrule, and it is
to the top of that mountain the green rushes were carried, according to
Manx tradition, as the only rent or tax which the inhabitants paid,
namely, to Manann&aacute;n mac Lir (called in Welsh Manawy&#273;an ab
&#7930;yr), whom the same tradition treats as father and founder, as
king and chief wizard of the Isle of Man, the same Manann&aacute;n who
is quaintly referred to in the illiterate passage at the head of this
chapter<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9795src" href="#xd26e9795" name=
"xd26e9795src">20</a>. As already stated, the payment of the annual
rent of rushes is associated with Midsummer Eve; but it did not prevent
the top of South Barrule from being visited likewise later in the year.
Perhaps it may also be worth while mentioning, with regard to most of
the mountains climbed on the first Sunday of Harvest, that they seem to
have near the summit of each a well of some celebrity, which appears to
be the goal of the visitors&rsquo; peregrinations. This is the case
with South Barrule, the spring near the top of which cannot, it is
said, be found when sought a second time; also with Snaefell and with
Maughold Head, which boasts one of the most famous springs in the
island. When I visited it last summer in company with Mr. Kermode, we
found it to contain a considerable number of pins, some of which were
bent, and many buttons. Some of the pins were not of a kind usually
carried by men, and most of the buttons decidedly belonged to the dress
of the other sex. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb315" href=
"#v1pb315" name="v1pb315">315</a>]</span>Several people who had
resorted many years ago to St. Maughold&rsquo;s Well, told me that the
water is good for sore eyes, and that after using it on the spot, or
filling a bottle with it to take home, one was wont to drop a pin or
bead or button into the well. But it had its full virtue only when
visited the first Sunday of Harvest, and that only during the hour when
the books were open at church, which, shifted back to Roman Catholic
times, means doubtless the hour when the priest was engaged in saying
Mass. Compare the passage in the <i>Mabinogi</i> of Math, where it is
said that the spear required for the slaying of &#7930;ew
&#7930;awgyffes had to be a whole year in the making: the work was to
be pursued only so long as one was engaged at the sacrifice on Sunday
(<i lang="cy">ar yr aberth du&#7933; sul</i>): see the Oxford
<i>Mabinogion</i>, p. 76. To return to Man, the restriction, as might
be expected, is not peculiar to St. Maughold&rsquo;s Well: I have heard
of it in connexion with other wells, such as Chibbyr Lansh in Lezayre
parish, and with a well on Slieau Maggyl, in which some Kirk Michael
people have a great belief. But even sea water was believed to have
considerable virtues if you washed in it while the books were open at
church, as I was told by a woman who had many years ago repeatedly
taken her own sister to divers wells and to the sea during the service
on Sunday, in order to have her eyes cured of a chronic weakness.</p>
<p id="v1ch4.11">The remaining great day in the Celtic year is called
<i>Sauin</i> or <i>Laa Houney</i>: in Irish, <i>Samhain</i>, genitive
<i>Samhna</i>. The Manx call it in English <i>Hollantide</i>, a word
derived from the English <i>All hallowen tide</i>, &lsquo;the Season of
All Saints<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9840src" href="#xd26e9840" name=
"xd26e9840src">21</a>.&rsquo; This day is also reckoned in Man
according to the Old Style, so that it is our twelfth of November. That
is the day when <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb316" href="#v1pb316"
name="v1pb316">316</a>]</span>the tenure of land terminates, and when
servant men go to their places. In other words, it is the beginning of
a new year; and Kelly, in his <i>Manx-English Dictionary</i>, has,
under the word <i>blein</i>, &lsquo;year,&rsquo; the following
note:&mdash;&lsquo;Vallancey says the Celts began their year with
January; yet in the Isle of Man the first of November is called New
Year&rsquo;s day by the Mummers, who, on the eve, begin their petition
in these words: <i>To-night is New Year&rsquo;s night,
Hog-unnaa</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e9857src" href="#xd26e9857"
name="xd26e9857src">22</a>, &amp;c.&rsquo; It is a pity that Kelly,
whilst he was on this subject, did not give the rhyme in Manx, and all
the more so, as the mummers of the present day, if he is right, must
have changed their words into <i>Noght oie Houney</i>, that is to say,
To-night is Sauin Night or Halloween. So I had despaired of finding
anybody who could corroborate Kelly in his statement, when I happened
last summer to find a man at Kirk Michael who was quite familiar with
this way of treating the year. I asked him if he could explain
Kelly&rsquo;s absurd statement&mdash;I put my question designedly in
that form. He said he could, but that there was nothing absurd in it.
He then told me how he had heard some old people talk of it: he is
himself now about sixty-seven. He had been a farm servant from the age
of sixteen till he was twenty-six to the same man, near Regaby, in the
parish of Andreas, and he remembers his master and a near neighbour of
his discussing the term New Year&rsquo;s Day as applied to the first of
November, and explaining to the younger men that it had always been so
in old times. In fact, it seemed to him natural enough, as all
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb317" href="#v1pb317" name=
"v1pb317">317</a>]</span>tenure of land ends at that time, and as all
servant men begin their service then. I cross-examined him, without
succeeding in any way in shaking his evidence. I should have been glad
a few years ago to have come across this piece of information, or even
Kelly&rsquo;s note, when I was discussing the Celtic year and trying to
prove<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9877src" href="#xd26e9877" name=
"xd26e9877src">23</a> that it began at the beginning of winter, with
May-day as the beginning of its second half.</p>
<p id="v1ch4.12">One of the characteristics of the beginning of the
Celtic year with the commencement of winter was the belief that
indications can be obtained on the eve of that day regarding the events
of the year; but with the calendar year gaining ground it would be
natural to expect that the Calends of January would have some of the
associations of the Calends of Winter transferred to them, and vice
versa. In fact, this can, as it were, be watched now going on in the
Isle of Man. First, I may mention that the Manx mummers used to go
about singing, in Manx, a sort of Hogmanay song<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e9885src" href="#xd26e9885" name="xd26e9885src">24</a>, reminding
one of that usual in Yorkshire and other parts of Great Britain, and
now known to be of Romance origin<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9922src"
href="#xd26e9922" name="xd26e9922src">25</a>. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb318" href="#v1pb318" name=
"v1pb318">318</a>]</span>The time for it in this country was New
Year&rsquo;s Eve, according to the ordinary calendar, but in the Isle
of Man it has always been Hollantide Eve, according to the Old Style,
and this is the night when boys now go about continuing the custom of
the old mummers. There is no hesitation in this case between Hollantide
Eve and New Year&rsquo;s Eve. But with the prognostications for the
year it is different, and the following practices have been usual. I
may, however, premise that as a rule I have abstained from inquiring
too closely whether they still go on, but here and there I have had the
information volunteered that they do.</p>
<p>1. I may mention first a salt prognostication, which was described
to me by a farmer in the north, whose wife practises it once a year
regularly. She carefully fills a thimble with salt in the evening and
upsets it in a neat little heap on a plate: she does that for every
member of the family, and every guest, too, if there happen to be any.
The plate is then left undisturbed till the morning, when she examines
the heaps of salt to see if any of them have fallen; for whoever is
found represented by a fallen heap will die during the year. She does
not herself, I am assured, believe in it, but she likes to continue a
custom which she has learned from her mother.</p>
<p>2. Next may be mentioned the ashes being carefully swept to the open
hearth, and nicely flattened down by the women just before going to
bed. In the morning they look for footmarks on the hearth, and if they
find such footmarks directed towards the door, it means, in the course
of the year, a death in the family, and if the reverse, they expect an
addition to it by marriage<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9951src" href=
"#xd26e9951" name="xd26e9951src">26</a>. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb319" href="#v1pb319" name="v1pb319">319</a>]</span></p>
<p>3. Then there is an elaborate process of eavesdropping recommended
to young women curious to know their future husbands&rsquo; names: a
girl would go with her mouth full of water and her hands full of salt
to the door of the nearest neighbour&rsquo;s house, or rather to that
of the nearest neighbour but one&mdash;I have been carefully corrected
more than once on that point. There she would listen, and the first
name she caught would prove to be that of her future husband. Once a
girl did so, as I was told by a blind fisherman in the south, and heard
two brothers quarrelling inside the house at whose door she was
listening. Presently the young men&rsquo;s mother exclaimed that the
devil would not let Tom leave John alone. At the mention of that triad
the girl burst into the house, laughing and spilling the mouthful of
water most incontinently. The end of it was that before the year was
out she married Tom, the second person mentioned: the first either did
not count or proved an unassailable bachelor.</p>
<p>4. There is also a ritual for enabling a girl to obtain other
information respecting her future husband: vessels placed about the
room have various things put into them, such as clean water, earth,
meal, a piece of a net, or any other article thought appropriate. The
candidate for matrimony, with her eyes bandaged, feels her way about
the house until she puts her hand in one of the aforesaid vessels. If
what she lays her hand on is the clean water, her husband will be a
handsome man<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9964src" href="#xd26e9964"
name="xd26e9964src">27</a>; if it is the earth, he will be a farmer; if
the meal, a miller; if the net, a fisherman; and so on into as many
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb320" href="#v1pb320" name=
"v1pb320">320</a>]</span>of the walks of life as may be thought worthy
of consideration.</p>
<p>5. Lastly, recourse may be had to a ritual of the same nature as
that observed by the druid of ancient Erin, when, burdened with a heavy
meal of the flesh of a red pig, he laid him down for the night in order
to await a prophetic dream as to the manner of man the nobles of Erin
assembled at Tara were to elect to be their king. The incident is given
in the story of C&uacute;chulainn&rsquo;s Sick-bed; and the reader,
doubtless, knows the passage about Brian and the <i>taghairm</i> in the
fourth Canto of Scott&rsquo;s <i>Lady of the Lake</i>. But the Manx
girl has only to eat a salt herring, bones and all, without drinking or
uttering a word, and to retire backwards to bed. When she sleeps and
dreams, she will behold her future husband approaching to give her
drink.</p>
<p>Probably none of the practices which I have enumerated, or similar
ones mentioned to me, are in any sense peculiar to the Isle of Man; but
what interests me in them is the divided opinion as to the proper night
for them in the year. I am sorry to say that I have very little
information as to the blindman&rsquo;s-buff ritual (No. 4); what
information I have, to wit, the evidence of two persons in the south,
fixes it on Hollantide Eve. But as to the others (Nos. 1, 2, 3, 5),
they are observed by some on that night, and by others on New
Year&rsquo;s Eve, sometimes according to the Old Style<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e9991src" href="#xd26e9991" name=
"xd26e9991src">28</a> and sometimes the New. Further, those who are
wont to practise the salt heap ritual, for instance, on Hollantide Eve,
would be very indignant to hear that anybody should think New
Year&rsquo;s Eve the proper night, and vice versa. So by bringing women
bred and born in different <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb321" href=
"#v1pb321" name="v1pb321">321</a>]</span>parishes to compare notes on
this point, I have witnessed arguing hardly less earnest than that
which characterized the ancient controversy between British and Italian
ecclesiastics as to the proper time for keeping Easter. I have not been
able to map the island according to the practices prevalent at
Hollantide and the beginning of January, but local folklorists could
probably do it without much difficulty. My impression, however, is that
January is gradually acquiring the upper hand. In Wales this must have
been decidedly helped by the influence of Roman rule and Roman ideas;
but even there the adjuncts of the Winter Calends have never been
wholly transferred to the Calends of January. Witness, for instance,
the women who used to congregate in the parish church to discover who
of the parishioners would die during the year<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e10005src" href="#xd26e10005" name="xd26e10005src">29</a>. That
custom, in the neighbourhoods reported to have practised it, continued
to attach itself to the last, so far as I know, to the beginning of
November. In the Isle of Man the fact of the ancient Celtic year having
so firmly held its own, seems to point to the probability that the year
of the Pagan Norsemen pretty nearly coincided with that of the
Celts<a class="noteref" id="xd26e10014src" href="#xd26e10014" name=
"xd26e10014src">30</a>. For there are reasons to think, as I have
endeavoured elsewhere to show, that the Norse Yule was originally at
the end of summer or the commencement of winter, in other words, the
days afterwards known as the Feast of the Winter Nights. This was the
favourite date in Iceland for listening to soothsayers prophesying with
regard to the winter then beginning. The late Dr. Vigfusson had much to
say <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb322" href="#v1pb322" name=
"v1pb322">322</a>]</span>on this subject, and how the local sibyl,
resuming her elevated seat at the opening of each successive winter,
gave the author of the <i>Volosp&aacute;</i> his plan of that
remarkable poem, which has been described by the same authority as the
highest spiritual effort of the heathen muse of the North. <span class=

<i>cuirn</i>, which is in Mod. Irish <i>caorthann</i>, genitive

is <i>cer&#273;in</i>, singular <i>cer&#273;inen</i>, and in the spoken

<i>cerdinen</i>, <i>cerdingen</i>. This variation seems to indicate
that these words have possibly been borrowed by the Welsh from a
Goidelic source; but the berry is known in Wales by the native name of
<i>criafol</i>, from which the wood is frequently called, especially in
North Wales, <i>coed criafol</i>, singular <i>coeden griafol</i> or
<i>pren criafol</i>. The sacredness of the rowan is the key to the
proper names Mac-C&aacute;irthinn and Der-Ch&aacute;irthinn, with which
the student of Irish hagiology is familiar. They mean the Son and the
Daughter of the Rowan respectively, and the former occurs as <i>Maqui

my impression that it is crowned with a small tumulus, and that it
forms the highest ground in Jurby, which was once an island by itself.
The one between Ramsey and Bride is also probably the highest point of
the range. But these are questions which I should like to see further
examined, say by Mr. Arthur Moore or Mr. Kermode.&nbsp;<a class=

<i lang="gv">Cronk yn Irree Laa</i>, despite the gender, is the name as
pronounced by all Manxmen who have not been misled by antiquarians. To
convey the other meaning, referring to the day watch, the name would
have to be <i lang="gv">Cronk ny Harrey Laa</i>; in fact, a part of the
Howe in the south of the island is called <i lang="gv">Cronk ny
Harrey</i>, &lsquo;the Hill of the Watch.&rsquo; Mr. Moore tells me
that the Jurby <i>cronk</i> was one of the eminences for &lsquo;Watch
and Ward&rsquo;; but he is now of opinion that the high mountain of
Cronk yn Irree Laa in the south was not. As to the duty of the
inhabitants to keep &lsquo;Watch and Ward&rsquo; over the island, see
the passage concerning it extracted from the Manx Statutes (vol. i. p.
65) by Mr. Moore in his <i>Manx Surnames</i>, pp. 183&ndash;3; also my

<p id="v1ch5.1" class="first">The last chapter is hardly such as to
call for a recapitulation of its principal contents, and I venture to
submit instead of any such repetition an abstract of some very
pertinent notes on it by Miss M. G. W. Peacock, who compares with the
folklore of the Isle of Man the old beliefs which survive in
Lincolnshire among the descendants of Norse ancestors<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e10048src" href="#xd26e10048" name="xd26e10048src">1</a>. She
was attracted by the striking affinity which she noticed between them,
and she is doubtless right in regarding that affinity as due in no
small degree to the Scandinavian element present in the population
alike of Man and the East of England. She is, however, not lavish of
theory, but gives us interesting items of information from an intimate
acquaintance with the folklore of the district of which she undertakes
to speak, somewhat in the following order:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. Whether the water-bull still inhabits the streams of Lincolnshire
she regards as doubtful, but the deep pools formed, she says, by the
action of the down-flowing water at the bends of the country becks are
still known as bull-holes. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb324" href=
"#v1pb324" name="v1pb324">324</a>]</span></p>
<p>2. As to the <i>glashtyn</i>, or water-horse, she remarks that the
tatter-foal, tatter-colt, or shag-foal, as he is variously called, is
still to be heard of, although his visits take place less often than
before the fens and carrs were drained and the open fields and commons
enclosed. She describes the tatter-foal as a goblin of the shape and
appearance of a small horse or yearling foal in his rough, unkempt
coat. He beguiles lonely travellers with his numberless tricks, one of
which is to lure them to a stream, swamp, or water-hole. When he has
succeeded he vanishes with a long outburst of mockery, half neigh, half
human laughter.</p>
<p>3. The fenodyree, one is told, has in Lincolnshire a cousin, but he
is diminutive; and, like the Yorkshire Hob or Robin Round-Cap, and the
Danish Niss, he is used to befriend the house in which he dwells. The
story of his driving the farmer&rsquo;s sheep home is the same
practically as in the Isle of Man, even to the point of bringing in
with them <i>the little grey sheep</i>, as he called the fine hare that
had given him more trouble than all the rest of the flock: see pp.
286&ndash;7 above.</p>
<p>4. The story of this manikin&rsquo;s clothing differs considerably
from that of the fenodyree. The farmer gives him in gratitude for his
services a linen shirt every New Year&rsquo;s Eve; and this went on for
years, until at last the farmer thought a hemp shirt was good enough to
give him. When the clock struck twelve at midnight the manikin raised
an angry wail, saying:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Harden, harden, harden hemp!</p>
<p class="line">I will neither grind nor stamp!</p>
<p class="line">Had you given me linen gear,</p>
<p class="line">I would have served you many a year!</p>
</div>
<p class="first">He was no more seen or heard: he vanished for ever.
The Cornish counterpart of this brownie reasons in the opposite way;
for when, in gratitude for his help in <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb325" href="#v1pb325" name="v1pb325">325</a>]</span>threshing, a
new suit of clothes is given him, he hurries away, crying<a class=

<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Pisky new coat, and pisky new hood,</p>
<p class="line">Pisky now will do no more good.</p>
</div>
<p id="v1ch5.2" class="first">Here, also, one should compare William
Nicholson&rsquo;s account of the brownie of Blednoch<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e10093src" href="#xd26e10093" name="xd26e10093src">3</a>, in

<p class="line">For frae that day forth he was nae mair seen,</p>
<p class="line xd26e10117">And sair missed was Aiken-drum!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">The only account which I have been able to find of a
Welsh counterpart will be found in <i lang="cy">Bwca&rsquo;r Trwyn</i>,
in chapter x: he differs in some important respects from the fenodyree
and the brownie.</p>
<p>5. A twig of the rowan tree, or <i>wicken</i>, as it is called, was
effective against all evil things, including witches. It is useful in
many ways to guard the welfare of the household, and to preserve both
the live stock and the crops, while placed on the churn it prevents any
malign influence from retarding the coming of the butter. I may remark
that Celts and Teutons seem to have been generally pretty well agreed
as to the virtues of the rowan tree. Bits of iron also are lucky
against witches. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb326" href="#v1pb326"
name="v1pb326">326</a>]</span></p>
<p>6. Fairies are rare, but witches and wizards abound, and some of
them have been supposed to change themselves into dogs to worry sheep
and cattle, or into toads to poison the swine&rsquo;s troughs. But they
do not seem to change themselves into hares, as in Man and other Celtic
lands.</p>
<p>7. Witchcraft, says Miss Peacock, is often hereditary, passing most
frequently from mother to daughter; but when a witch has no daughter
her power may appear in a son, and then revert to the female line. This
appears far more natural than the Manx belief in its passing from
father to daughter and from daughter to son. But another kind of
succession is mentioned in the Welsh Triads, i. 32, ii. 20, iii. 90,
which speak of Math ab Mathonwy teaching his magic to Gwydion, who as
his sister&rsquo;s son was to succeed him in his kingdom; and of a
certain Rhu&#273;lwm Dwarf teaching his magic to Co&#7931;, son of
Co&#7931;frewi, his nephew. Both instances seem to point to a state of
society which did not reckon paternity but only birth.</p>
<p>8. Only three years previous to Miss Peacock&rsquo;s writing an old
man died, she says, who had seen blood drawn from a witch because she
had, as was supposed, laid a spell on a team of horses: as soon as she
was struck so as to bleed the horses and their load were free to go on
their way again. Possibly no equally late instance could be specified
in the Isle of Man: see p. 296 above.</p>
<p>9. Traces of animal sacrifice may still be found in Lincolnshire,
for the heart of a small beast, or of a bird, is necessary, Miss
Peacock says, for the efficient performance of several counter-charms,
especially in torturing a witch by the reversal of her spells, and
warding off evil from houses or other buildings. Apparently Miss
Peacock has not heard of so considerable a victim <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb327" href="#v1pb327" name=
"v1pb327">327</a>]</span>as a sheep or a calf being sacrificed, as in
the Isle of Man, but the objects of the sacrifices may be said to be
the same.</p>
<p>10. Several pin and rag wells are said to exist in Lincolnshire,
their waters being supposed to possess healing virtues, especially as
regards eye ailments.</p>
<p id="v1ch5.3">11. Love-spells and prognostications are mentioned,
some of them as belonging to Allhallows, as they do partly in the Isle
of Man: she mentions the making of dumb cake, and the eating of the
salt herring, followed by dreams of the future husband bringing the
thirsting lass drink in a jug, the quality of which indicates the
bearer&rsquo;s position in life. But other Lincolnshire practices of
the kind seem to oscillate between Allhallows and St. Mark&rsquo;s Eve,
while gravitating decidedly towards the latter date. Here it is
preferable to give Miss Peacock&rsquo;s own
words:&mdash;&lsquo;Professor Rhys&rsquo; mention of the footmark in
the ashes reminds me of a love-spell current in the Wapentake of Manley
in North Lincolnshire. Properly speaking, it should be put in practice
on St. Mark&rsquo;s E&rsquo;en, that eerie spring-tide festival when
those who are skilled may watch the church porch and learn who will die
in the ensuing twelvemonth; but there is little doubt that the charm is
also used at Hallow E&rsquo;en, and at other suitable seasons of the
year. The spell consists in riddling ashes on the hearthstone, or beans
on the floor of the barn, with proper ceremonies and at the proper
time, with the result that the girl who works her incantation correctly
finds the footprint of the man she is to marry clearly marked on the
sifted mass the following morning. It is to be supposed that the spirit
of the lover is responsible for the mark, as, according to another
folk-belief, any girl who watches her supper on St. Mark&rsquo;s
E&rsquo;en will see the spirit of the man she will wed come into the
room at midnight to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb328" href=
"#v1pb328" name="v1pb328">328</a>]</span>partake of the food provided.
The room must be one with the door and windows in different walls, and
both must be open. The spirit comes in by the door (and goes out by the
window?). Each girl who undertakes to keep watch must have a separate
supper and a separate candle, and all talking is to end before the
clock goes twelve, for there must not be any speaking before the
spirits. From these superstitions, and from the generally received idea
that the spirits of all the parishioners are to be observed entering
the church on St. Mark&rsquo;s E&rsquo;en, it may be inferred that the
Manx footprint is made by the wraith of the person doomed to
death.&rsquo; Compare pp. 318&ndash;9 above.</p>
<p>What Miss Peacock alludes to as watching the church porch was
formerly well known in Wales<a class="noteref" id="xd26e10158src" href=
"#xd26e10158" name="xd26e10158src">4</a>, and may be illustrated from a
district so far east as the Golden Valley, in Herefordshire, by the
following story told me in 1892 by Mrs. Powell of Dorstone, on the
strength of what she had learnt from her mother-in-law, the late Mrs.
Powell, who was a native of that parish:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;On Allhallows Eve at midnight, those who are bold enough to
look through the church windows will see the building lighted with an
unearthly light, and the pulpit occupied by his Satanic majesty clothed
in a monk&rsquo;s habit. Dreadful anathemas are the burden of his
preaching, and the names of those who in the coming year are to render
up their souls may be heard by those who have courage to listen. A
notorious evil liver, Jack of France, once by chance passed the church
at this awful moment: looking in he saw the lights and heard the voice,
and his own name in the horrid list; and, according to some versions of
the story, he went home <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb329" href=
"#v1pb329" name="v1pb329">329</a>]</span>to die of fright. Others say
that he repented and died in good repute, and so cheated the evil one
of his prey.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I have no list of places in Wales and its marches which have this
sort of superstition associated with them, but it is my impression that
they are mostly referred to Allhallows, as at Dorstone, and that where
that is not the case they have been shifted to the beginning of the
year as at present reckoned; for in Celtic lands, at least, they seem
to have belonged to what was reckoned the beginning of the year. The
old Celtic year undoubtedly began at Allhallows, and the day next in
importance after the Calends of Winter (in Welsh
<i>Calang&aacute;eaf</i>) was, among the Celts, the beginning of the
summer half of the year, or the Calends of May (in Welsh
<i>Cal&aacute;nmai</i>), which St. Mark&rsquo;s Eve approaches too
nearly for us to regard it as accidental. With this modified agreement
between the Lincolnshire date and the Celtic one contrast the
irreconcilable English date of St. John&rsquo;s Eve; and see
Tylor&rsquo;s <i>Primitive Culture</i>, i. 440, where one reads as
follows of &lsquo;the well-known superstition,&rsquo; &lsquo;that
fasting watchers on St. John&rsquo;s Eve may see the apparitions of
those doomed to die during the year come with the clergyman to the
church door and knock; these apparitions are spirits who come forth
from their bodies, for the minister has been noticed to be much
troubled in his sleep while his phantom was thus engaged, and when one
of a party of watchers fell into a sound sleep and could not be roused,
the others saw his apparition knock at the church door.&rsquo; With an
unerring instinct for the intelligent colligation of facts, Miss
Peacock finds the nearest approach to the yearly review of the
moritures, if I may briefly so call them, in the wraith&rsquo;s
footprint in the ashes. Perhaps a more systematic examination of Manx
folklore may result in the discovery of a more exact parallel.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb330" href="#v1pb330" name=
"v1pb330">330</a>]</span></p>
<p>For want of knowing where else to put it, I may mention here in
reference to the dead, a passage which has been copied for me by my
friend Mr. Gwenogvryn Evans, from Manuscript 163 in the Peniarth
Collection. I understand it to be of the earlier part of the sixteenth
century, and p. 10 has the following passage:&mdash;</p>
<p lang="cy"><i>Yn yr ynys honn</i> [<i>Manaw</i>] <i>y kair gweled liw
dy&#273; bobyl a vvessynt veirw / Rrai gwedi tori penav / erai&#7931;
gwedi torri i haelode / Ac os dieithred a &#273;issyfynt i gweled hwynt
/ Sengi ar draed gwyr or tir ac ve&#7931;y hwynt a gaent weled yr hyn a
welssynt hwyntav.</i></p>
<p>&lsquo;In this island [Man] one beholds in the light of day people
who have died, some with their heads cut off and others with their
limbs cut off. And if strangers desire to see them, they have to stand
on the feet of the natives of the land, and in that way they would see
what the latter had seen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A similar instance of the virtue of standing on the feet of another
person has been mentioned in reference to the farmer of Deunant, at p.
230 above; the foot, however, on which he had to stand in order to get
a glimpse of the fairy world, was a fairy&rsquo;s own foot.</p>
<p>Lastly, the passage in the Peniarth Manuscript has something more to
say of the Isle of Man, as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p id="v1ch5.4" lang="cy"><i>Mawr oe&#273; arfer o swynion a
chyvare&#273;ion gynt yn yr ynys honn / Kanys gwrage&#273; a
vy&#273;ynt yno yn gwnevthvr gwynt i longwyr gwedir gav mewn tri chwlm
o edav aphan vai eissie gwynt arnynt dattod kwlm or edav
anaynt.</i></p>
<p>&lsquo;Great was the practice formerly of spells and sorceries in
this island; for there used to be there women making wind for sailors,
which wind they confined within three knots made on a thread. And when
they had need of wind they would undo a knot of the thread.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This was written in the sixteenth century, and based probably on
Higden&rsquo;s <i>Polychronicon</i>, book I, chap. xliv<span class=
"corr" id="xd26e10210" title="Not in source">.</span> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb331" href="#v1pb331" name=
"v1pb331">331</a>]</span>(= I. 42&ndash;3), but the same practice of
wind making goes on to this day, one of the principal practitioners
being the woman to whom reference was made at p. 299. She is said to
tie the breezes in so many knots which she makes on the purchasing
sailor&rsquo;s pocket-handkerchief. This reminds one of the sibyl of
Warinsey, or the Island of Guernsey, who is represented by an ancient
Norse poet as &lsquo;fashioning false prophecies.&rsquo; See Vigfusson
and Powell&rsquo;s <i>Corpus Poeticum Boreale</i>, i. 136; also
Mela&rsquo;s first-century account of the virgins of the island of
Sena, which runs to the following effect:&mdash;&lsquo;Sena, in the
Britannic Sea, opposite the coast of the Osismi, is famous for its
oracle of a Gaulish god, whose priestesses, living in the holiness of
perpetual virginity, are said to be nine in number. They call them
Gallizen&aelig;, and they believe them to be endowed with extraordinary
gifts to rouse the sea and the wind by their incantations, to turn
themselves into whatsoever animal form they may choose, to cure
diseases which among others are incurable, to know what is to come and
to foretell it. They are, however, devoted to the service of voyagers
only who have set out on no other errand than to consult them<a class=

<p id="v1ch5.5">In the last chapter I made allusion to several wells of
greater or less celebrity in the Isle of Man; but I find that I have a
few remarks to add. Mr. Arthur Moore, in his book on <i>Manx Surnames
and Place-Names</i>, p. 200, mentions a Chibber Unjin, which means the
Well of the Ash-tree, and he states that there grew near it
&lsquo;formerly a sacred ash-tree, where votive offerings were
hung.&rsquo; The ash-tree calls to his mind Scandinavian legends
respecting the ash, but in any case one may suppose the ash was not the
usual tree to expect by a well in the Isle of Man, otherwise this one
would scarcely have been distinguished as the Ash-tree Well. The tree
to expect by a sacred well is doubtless some kind of thorn, as in the
case of Chibber Undin in the parish of Malew. The name means Foundation
Well, so called in reference probably to the foundations of an ancient
cell, or <i>keeill</i> as it is called in Manx, which lie close by, and
are found to measure twenty-one feet long by twelve feet broad. The
following is Mr. Moore&rsquo;s account of the well in his book already
cited, p. 181:&mdash;&lsquo;The water of this well is supposed to have
curative properties. The patients who came to it, took a mouthful of
water, retaining it in their mouths till they had twice walked round
the well. They then took a piece of cloth from a garment which they had
worn, wetted it with the water from the well, and hung it on the
hawthorn tree which grew there. When the cloth had rotted away, the
cure was supposed to be effected.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I visited the spot a few years ago in the company of the Rev. E. B.
Savage of St. Thomas&rsquo; Parsonage, Douglas, and we found the well
nearly dried up in consequence of the drainage of the field around it;
but the remains of the old cell were there, and the thorn bush had
strips of cloth or calico tied to its branches. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb333" href="#v1pb333" name=
"v1pb333">333</a>]</span>We cut off one, which is now in the
Pitt-Rivers Museum at Oxford. The account Mr. Savage had of the ritual
observed at the well differed a little from that given by Mr. Moore,
especially in the fact that it made the patient who had been walking
round the well with water from the well in his mouth, empty that water
finally into a rag from his clothing: the rag was then tied to a branch
of the thorn. It does not appear that the kind of tree mattered much;
nay, a tree is not, it seems to me, essential. At any rate, St.
Maughold&rsquo;s Well has no tree growing near it now; but it is right
to say, that when Mr. Kermode and I visited it, we could find no rags
left near the spot, nor indeed could we expect to find any, as there
was nothing to which they might be tied on that windy headland. The
absence of the tree does not, however, prove that the same sort of
ritual was not formerly observed at St. Maughold&rsquo;s Well as at
Chibber Undin; and here I must mention another well which I have
visited in the island more than once. It is on the side of Bradda Hill,
a little above the village of Bradda, and in the direction of
Fleshwick: I was attracted to it by the fact that it had, as I had been
told by Mr. Savage, formerly an old cell or <i>keeill</i> near it, and
the name of the saint to which it belonged may probably be gathered
from the name of the well, which, in the Manx of the south of the
island, is Chibbyrt Valtane, pronounced approximately
Ch&#365;&#769;vurt Volt&aacute;ne or Ol&#273;&aacute;ne. The personal
name would be written in modern Manx in its radical form as Boltane,
and if it occurred in the genitive in Ogam inscriptions I should expect
to find it written <i>Boltagni</i> or <i>Baltagni</i><a class="noteref"
id="xd26e10280src" href="#xd26e10280" name="xd26e10280src">8</a>. It
is, however, unknown to me, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb334"
href="#v1pb334" name="v1pb334">334</a>]</span>though to be placed
possibly by the side of the name of the saint after whom the parish of
Santon is called in the south-east of the island. This is pronounced in
Manx approximately<a class="noteref" id="xd26e10329src" href=
"#xd26e10329" name="xd26e10329src">9</a> Santane or San&#273;ane, and
would have yielded an early inscriptional nominative <span class=
"sc">SANCTANVS</span>, which, in fact, occurs on an old stone near
&#7930;andudno on the Welsh coast: see some notes of mine in point in
the <i lang="la">Arch&aelig;ologia Cambrensis</i>, 1897, pp.
140&ndash;2. To return to the well, it would seem to have been
associated with an old cell, but it has no tree growing by. Mr. Savage
and I were told, nevertheless, that a boy who had searched the well a
short time previously had got some coins out of it, quite recent ones,
consisting of halfpennies or pennies, so far as I remember. On my
observing to one of the neighbours that I saw no rags there, I was
assured that there had been some; and, on my further saying that I saw
no tree there to which they could be tied, I was told that they used to
be attached to the brambles, which grew there in great abundance. Thus
it appears that, in the Isle of Man at any rate, a tree to bear the
rags was not an essential adjunct of a holy well.</p>
<p>Before leaving these well superstitions the reader may wish to know
how they were understood in Ireland <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb335" href="#v1pb335" name="v1pb335">335</a>]</span>not long ago:
so I venture to quote a passage from a letter by the late Mr. W. C.
Borlase on Rag Offerings and Primitive <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e10351" title="Source: Pilgimages">Pilgrimages</span> in Ireland,
as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Among the MSS. of the late Mr. Windele, of Cork, &hellip; I
find a passage which cannot fail to interest students of folk-lore. It
relates to the custom of affixing shreds of rag to the hawthorn tree,
which almost invariably stands by the brink of the typical Irish
&ldquo;holy well,&rdquo; and it gives us the meaning of the custom as
understood, some half-century since, by the inhabitants of certain
localities in the province of Munster. The idea is, says the writer,
that the putting up these rags is a putting away of the evils impending
or incurred by sin, an act accompanied by the following ritual words:
<i>Air impide an Tiarna mo chuid teinis do fhagaint air an ait so</i>;
i. e. By the intercession of the Lord I leave my portion of illness on
this place. These words, he adds, should be uttered by whoever performs
the round, and they are, no doubt, of extreme antiquity. Mr. Windele
doubtless took down the words as he heard them locally pronounced,
though, to be correct, for <i>Tiarna</i> should be read <i>Tigerna</i>;
for <i>teinis</i>, <i>tinneas</i>; and for <i>fhagaint</i>,
<i>fhagaim</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e10377src" href="#xd26e10377"
name="xd26e10377src">10</a>.&rsquo;</p>
<p id="v1ch5.6">From the less known saints Boltane and Santane I wish
to pass to the mention of a more famous one, namely, St. Catherine, and
this because of a fair called after her, and held on the sixth day of
December at the village of Colby in the south of the island. When I
heard of this fair in 1888, it was in temporary abeyance on account of
a lawsuit respecting the plot of ground on which the fair is wont to be
held; but I was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb336" href="#v1pb336"
name="v1pb336">336</a>]</span>told that it usually begins with a
procession, in which a live hen is carried about: this is called St.
Catherine&rsquo;s hen. The next day the hen is carried about dead and
plucked, and a rhyme pronounced at a certain point in the proceedings
contemplates the burial of the hen, but whether that ever takes place I
know not. It runs thus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="gv" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>Kiark Catrina marroo:</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>Gows yn kione as goyms ny cassyn,</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>As ver mayd ee fo&rsquo;n thalloo.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Catherine&rsquo;s hen is dead:</p>
<p class="line">The head take thou and I the feet,</p>
<p class="line">We shall put her under the ground.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">A man who is found to be not wholly sober after the
fair is locally said to have plucked a feather from the hen (<i lang=
"gv">T&rsquo;eh er goaill fedjag ass y chiark</i>); so it would seem
that there must be such a scramble to get at the hen, and to take part
in the plucking, that it requires a certain amount of drink to allay
the thirst of the over zealous devotees of St. Catherine. But why
should this ceremony be associated with St. Catherine? and what were
the origin and meaning of it? These are questions on which I should be
glad to have light shed.</p>
<p id="v1ch5.7">Manx has a word <i>quaail</i> (Irish
<i>comhdh&aacute;il</i>), meaning a &lsquo;meeting,&rsquo; and from it
we have a derivative <i>quaaltagh</i> or <i>qualtagh</i>, meaning,
according to Kelly&rsquo;s <i>Dictionary</i>, &lsquo;the first person
or creature one meets going from home,&rsquo; whereby the author can
have only meant the first met by one who is going from home. Kelly goes
on to add that &lsquo;this person is of great consequence to the
superstitious, particularly to women the first time they go out after
lying-in.&rsquo; Cregeen, in his <i>Dictionary</i>, defines the
<i>qualtagh</i> as &lsquo;the first person met on New Year&rsquo;s Day,
or on going on some new work, &amp;c.&rsquo; Before proceeding to give
the substance of my notes on the <i>qualtagh</i> of the present day I
may as well finish with Cregeen, for he adds the following
information:&mdash;&lsquo;A company of young lads or men generally went
in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb337" href="#v1pb337" name=
"v1pb337">337</a>]</span>old times on what they termed the
<i>qualtagh</i>, at Christmas or New Year&rsquo;s Day, to the houses of
their more wealthy neighbours; some one of the company repeating in an
audible voice the following rhyme:&mdash;</p>
<div lang="gv" class="lgouter">
<p class="line"><i>Ollick ghennal erriu as ble&iuml;n feer vie,</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>Seihll as slaynt da&rsquo;n slane lught

<p class="line"><i>Cadley sauchey tra vees shiu ny lhie,</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>As feeackle y jargan, nagh bee dy

</div>
<p class="first">It may be loosely translated as follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">A merry Christmas, a happy new year,</p>
<p class="line">Long life and health to all the household here.</p>
<p class="line">Food and mirth to you dwelling together,</p>

<p class="line">Die like a mouse in a barn or haggard;</p>
<p class="line">In safety sleep while you lie to rest,</p>
<p class="line">And by the flea&rsquo;s tooth be not distressed.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">At present New Year&rsquo;s Day is the time when the
<i>qualtagh</i> is of general interest, and in this case he is, outside
the members of one&rsquo;s own household, practically the first person
one sees on the morning of that day, whether that person meets one out
of doors or comes to one&rsquo;s house. The following is what I have
learnt by inquiry as to the <i>qualtagh</i>: all are agreed that he
must not be a woman or girl, and that he must not be <i>spaagagh</i> or
splay footed, while a woman from the parish of Marown told me that he
must not have red hair. The prevalent belief, however, is that he
should be a dark haired man or boy, and it is of no consequence how
rough his appearance may be, provided he be black haired. However, I
was told by one man in Rushen that the <i>qualtagh</i> or
&lsquo;first-foot&rsquo; need not be <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb338" href="#v1pb338" name="v1pb338">338</a>]</span>a black haired
person: he must be a man or boy. But this less restricted view is not
the one held in the central and northern parts of the island, so far as
I could ascertain. An English lady living in the neighbourhood of
Castletown told me that her son, whom I know to be, like his mother, a
blond, not being aware what consequences might be associated with his
visit, called at a house in Castletown on the morning of New
Year&rsquo;s Day, and he chanced to be the <i>qualtagh</i>. The
mistress of the house was horrified, and expressed to the English lady
her anticipation of misfortunes; and as it happened that one of the
children of the house died in the course of the year, the English lady
has been reminded of it since. Naturally the association of these
events are not pleasant to her; but, so far as I can remember, they
date only some eight or nine years ago<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e10536src" href="#xd26e10536" name="xd26e10536src">11</a>.</p>
<p>By way of bringing Wales into comparison with Man, I may mention
that, when I was a very small boy, I used to be sent very early on New
Year&rsquo;s morning to call on an old uncle of mine, because, as I was
told, I should be certain to receive a <i>calennig</i> or a
calends&rsquo; gift from him, but on no account would my sister be
allowed to go, as he would only see a boy on such an occasion as that.
I do not recollect anything being said as to the colour of one&rsquo;s
hair or the shape of one&rsquo;s foot; but that sort of negative
evidence is of very little value, as the <i>qualtagh</i> was fast
passing out of consideration.</p>
<p>The preference here given to a boy over a girl looks like one of the
widely spread superstitions which rule against the fair sex; but, as to
the colour of the hair, I should be predisposed to think that it
possibly rests <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb339" href="#v1pb339"
name="v1pb339">339</a>]</span>on racial antipathy, long ago forgotten;
for it might perhaps be regarded as going back to a time when the dark
haired race reckoned the Aryan of fair complexion as his natural enemy,
the very sight of whom brought with it thoughts calculated to make him
unhappy and despondent. If this idea proved to be approximately
correct, one might suggest that the racial distinction in question
referred to the struggles between the inhabitants of Man and their
Scandinavian conquerors; but to my thinking it is just as likely that
it goes much further back.</p>
<p>Lastly, what is one to say with regard to the <i>spaagagh</i> or
splay footed person, now more usually defined as flat footed or having
no instep? I have heard it said in the south of the island that it is
unlucky to meet a <i>spaagagh</i> in the morning at any time of the
year, and not on New Year&rsquo;s Day alone; but this does not help us
in the attempt to find the genesis of this belief. If it were said that
it was unlucky to meet a deformed person, it would look somewhat more
natural; but why fix on the flat footed especially? For my part I have
not been trained to distinguish flat footed people, so I do not
recollect noticing any in the Isle of Man; but, granting there may be a
small proportion of such people in the island, does it not seem strange
that they should have their importance so magnified as this
superstition would seem to imply? I must confess that I cannot
understand it, unless we have here also some supposed racial
characteristic, let us say greatly exaggerated. To explain myself I
should put it that the non-Aryan aborigines were a small people of
great agility and nimbleness, and that their Aryan conquerors moved
more slowly and deliberately, whence the former, of springier
movements, might come to nickname the latter the flat footed. It is
even conceivable that there was some <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb340" href="#v1pb340" name="v1pb340">340</a>]</span>amount of
foundation for it in fact. If I might speak from my own experience, I
might mention a difficulty I have often had with shoes of English make,
namely, that I have always found them, unless made to measure, apt to
have their instep too low for me. It has never occurred to me to buy
ready-made shoes in France or Germany, but I know a lady as Welsh as I
am, who has often bought shoes in France, and her experience is, that
it is much easier for her to get shoes there to fit her than in
England, and for the very reason which I have already suggested,
namely, that the instep in English shoes is lower than in French
ones.</p>
<p>Again, I may mention that one day last term<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e10566src" href="#xd26e10566" name="xd26e10566src">12</a>, having
to address a meeting of Welsh undergraduates on folklore, I ventured to
introduce this question. They agreed with me that English shoes did
not, as a rule, fit Welsh feet, and this because they are made too low
in the instep: I ought to have said that they all agreed except one
undergraduate, who held his peace. He is a tall man, powerful in the
football field, but of no dark complexion, and I have never dared to
look in the direction of his feet since, lest he should catch me
carrying my comparisons to cruel extremes. Perhaps the flatness of the
feet of the one race is not emphasized so much as the height of the
instep in those of the other. At any rate I find this way of looking at
the question somewhat countenanced by a journalist who refers his
readers to Wm. Henderson&rsquo;s notes on the <i>Folklore of the
Northern Counties</i>, p. 74. The passage relates more particularly to
Northumberland, and runs as follows:&mdash;&lsquo;In some districts,
however, special weight is attached to the &ldquo;first-foot&rdquo;
being that of a person with a high-arched instep, a foot that
&ldquo;water runs under.&rdquo; A flat-footed person would bring great
ill-luck for the coming year.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb341" href="#v1pb341" name="v1pb341">341</a>]</span></p>
<p>These instances do not warrant the induction that Celts are higher
in the instep than Teutons, and that they have inherited that
characteristic from the non-Aryan element in their ancestry. Perhaps
the explanation is, at least in part, that the dwellers in hilly
regions tend to be more springy and to have higher insteps than the
inhabitants of flatter lands. The statement of Dr. Karl Blind on this
point does not help one to a decision when he speaks as follows in
<i>Folk-Lore</i> for 1892, p. 89:&mdash;&lsquo;As to the instep, I can
speak from personal experience. Almost every German finds that an
English shoemaker makes his boots not high enough in the instep. The
northern Germans (I am from the south) have perhaps slightly flatter
feet than the southern Germans.&rsquo; The first part of the comparison
is somewhat of a surprise to me, but not so the other part, that the
southern Germans inhabiting a hillier country, and belonging to a
different race, may well be higher in the instep than the more northern
speakers of the German language. But on the whole the more one examines
the <i>qualtagh</i>, the less clearly one sees how he can be the
representative of a particular race. More data possibly would enable
one to arrive at greater probability.</p>
<p>There is one other question which I should like to ask before
leaving the <i>qualtagh</i>, namely, as to the relation of the custom
of New Year&rsquo;s gifts to the belief in the <i>qualtagh</i>. I have
heard it related in the Isle of Man that women have been known to keep
indoors on New Year&rsquo;s Day until the <i>qualtagh</i> comes, which
sometimes means their being prisoners for the greater part of the day,
in order to avoid the risk of first meeting one who is not of the right
sex and complexion. On the other hand, when the <i>qualtagh</i> is of
the right description, considerable fuss is made of him; to say the
least, he has to accept food and drink, possibly more permanent
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb342" href="#v1pb342" name=
"v1pb342">342</a>]</span>gifts. Thus a tall, black haired native of
Kirk Michael described to me how he chanced on New Year&rsquo;s Day,
years ago, to turn into a lonely cottage in order to light his pipe,
and how he found he was the <i>qualtagh</i>: he had to sit down to have
food, and when he went away it was with a present and the blessings of
the family. Now New Year&rsquo;s Day is the time for gifts in Wales, as
shown by the name for them, <i>calennig</i>, which is derived from
<i>calan</i>, the Welsh form of the Latin <i>calend&aelig;</i>, New
Year&rsquo;s Day being in Welsh <i>Y Calan</i>, &lsquo;the
Calends.&rsquo; The same is the day for gifts in Scotland and in
Ireland, except in so far as Christmas boxes have been making inroads
from England: I need not add that the <i>Jour de l&rsquo;An</i> is the
day for gifts also in France. My question then is this: Is there any
essential connexion of origin between the institution of New
Year&rsquo;s Day gifts and the belief in the first-foot?</p>
<p id="v1ch5.8">Now that it has been indicated what sort of a
<i>qualtagh</i> it is unlucky to have, I may as well proceed to mention
the other things which I have heard treated as unlucky in the island.
Some of them scarcely require to be noticed, as there is nothing
specially Manx about them, such as the belief that it is unlucky to
have the first glimpse of the new moon through glass. That is a
superstition which is, I believe, widely spread, and, among other
countries, it is quite familiar in Wales, where it is also unlucky to
see the moon for the first time through a hedge or over a house. What
this means I cannot guess, unless it be that it was once considered
one&rsquo;s duty to watch the first appearance of the new moon from the
highest point in the landscape of the district in which one dwelt. Such
a point would in that case become the chief centre of a moon worship
now lost in oblivion.</p>
<p>It is believed in Man, as it used to be in Wales and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb343" href="#v1pb343" name=
"v1pb343">343</a>]</span>Ireland, that it is unlucky to disturb
antiquities, especially old burial places and old churches. This
superstition is unfortunately passing away in all three countries, but
you still hear of it, especially in the Isle of Man, mostly after
mischief has been done. Thus a good Manx scholar told me how a relative
of his in the Ronnag, a small valley near South Barrule, had carted
away the earth from an old burial ground on his farm and used it as
manure for his fields, and how his beasts died afterwards. The narrator
said he did not know whether there was any truth in it, but everybody
believed that it was the reason why the cattle died; and so did the
farmer himself at last: so he desisted from completing his disturbance
of the old site. It is possibly for a similar reason that a house in
ruins is seldom pulled down, or the materials used for other buildings.
Where that has been done misfortunes have ensued; at any rate, I have
heard it said so more than once. I ought to have stated that the
non-disturbance of antiquities in the island is quite consistent with
their being now and then shamefully neglected as elsewhere. This is now
met by an excellent statute recently enacted by the House of Keys for
the preservation of the public monuments of the island.</p>
<p>Of the other and more purely Manx superstitions I may mention one
which obtains among the Peel fishermen of the present day: no boat is
willing to be third in the order of sailing out from Peel harbour to
the fisheries. So it sometimes happens that after two boats have
departed, the others remain watching each other for days, each hoping
that somebody else may be reckless enough to break through the
invisible barrier of &lsquo;bad luck.&rsquo; I have often asked for an
explanation of this superstition, but the only intelligible answer I
have had was that it has been observed that the third boat <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb344" href="#v1pb344" name=
"v1pb344">344</a>]</span>has done badly several years in succession;
but I am unable to ascertain how far that represents the fact. Another
of the unlucky things is to have a white stone in the boat, even in the
ballast, and for that I never could get any explanation at all; but
there is no doubt as to the fact of this superstition, and I may
illustrate it from the case of a clergyman&rsquo;s son on the west
side, who took it into his head to go out with some fishermen several
days in succession. They chanced to be unsuccessful each time, and they
gave their Jonah the nickname of <i>Clagh Vane</i>, or &lsquo;White
Stone.&rsquo; Now what can be the origin of this tabu? It seems to me
that if the Manx had once a habit of adorning the graves of the
departed with white stones, that circumstance would be a reasonable
explanation of the superstition in question. Further, it is quite
possible they did, and here Manx arch&aelig;ologists could probably
help as to the matter of fact. In the absence, however, of information
to the point from Man, I take the liberty of citing some relating to
Scotland. It comes from Mr. Gomme&rsquo;s presidential address to the
Folk-Lore Society: see <i>Folk-Lore</i> for 1893, pp.
13&ndash;4:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Near Inverary, it is the custom among the fisher-folk, and
has been so within the memory of the oldest, to place little white
stones or pebbles on the graves of their friends. No reason is now
given for the practice, beyond that most potent and delightful of all
reasons in the minds of folk-lore students, namely, that it has always
been done. Now there is nothing between this modern practice sanctioned
by traditional observance and the practice of the stone-age people in
the same neighbourhood and in others, as made known to us by their
grave-relics. Thus, in a cairn at Achnacrie opened by Dr. Angus Smith,
on entering the innermost chamber &ldquo;the first thing that struck
the eye was a row of quartz <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb345"
href="#v1pb345" name="v1pb345">345</a>]</span>pebbles larger than a
walnut; these were arranged on the ledge of the lower granite block of
the east side.&rdquo; Near Crinan, at Duncraigaig and at Rudie, the
same characteristic was observed, and Canon Greenwell, who examined the
cairns, says the pebbles &ldquo;must have been placed there with some
intention, and probably possessed a symbolic
meaning.&rdquo;&#8202;&rsquo; See also <i>Burghead</i>, by Mr. H. W.
Young (Inverness, 1899), p. 10, where we read that at Burghead the
&lsquo;smooth white pebbles, sometimes five or seven of them, but never
more,&rsquo; have been usually arranged as crosses on the graves which
he has found under the fallen ramparts. Can this be a Christian
superstition with the white stones of the Apocalypse as its
foundation?</p>
<p>Here I may mention a fact which I do not know where else to put,
namely, that a fisherman on his way in the morning to the fishing, and
chancing to pass by the cottage of another fisherman who is not on
friendly terms with him, will pluck a straw from the thatch of the
latter&rsquo;s dwelling. Thereby he is supposed to rob him of his luck
in the fishing for that day. One would expect to learn that the straw
from the thatch served as the subject of an incantation directed
against the owner of the thatch. I have never heard anything suggested
to that effect; but I conclude that the plucking of the straw is only a
partial survival of what was once a complete ritual for bewitching
one&rsquo;s neighbour, unless getting possession of the straw was
supposed to carry with it possession of everything belonging to the
other man, including his luck in fishing for that day.</p>
<p>Owing to my ignorance as to the superstitions of other fishermen
than those of the Isle of Man, I will not attempt to classify the
remaining instances to be mentioned, such as the unluckiness of
mentioning a horse or a mouse on board a fishing-boat: I seem,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb346" href="#v1pb346" name=
"v1pb346">346</a>]</span>however, to have heard of similar tabus among
Scottish fishermen; and, according to Dr. Blind, Shetland fishermen
will not mention a church or a clergyman when out at sea, but use quite
other names for both when on board a ship (<i>Folk-Lore</i> for 1892,
p. 89). Novices in the Manx fisheries have to learn not to point to
anything with one finger: they have to point with the whole hand or not
at all. This looks as if it belonged to a code of rules as to the use
of the hand, such as prevail among the Neapolitans and other peoples
whose chief article of faith is the belief in malign influences: see
Mr. Elworthy&rsquo;s volume on <i>The Evil Eye</i>.</p>
<p>Whether the Manx are alone in thinking it unlucky to lend salt from
one boat to another when they are engaged in the fishing, I know not:
such lending would probably be inconvenient, but why it should be
unlucky, as they believe it to be, does not appear. The first of May is
a day on which it is unlucky to lend anything, and especially to give
anyone fire<a class="noteref" id="xd26e10657src" href="#xd26e10657"
name="xd26e10657src">13</a>. This looks as if it pointed back to some
druidic custom of lighting all fires at that time from a sacred hearth,
but, so far as is known, this only took place at the beginning of the
other half-year, namely, <i>Sauin</i> or Allhallows, which is sometimes
rendered into Manx as <i>Laa &rsquo;ll mooar ny Saintsh</i>, &lsquo;the
Day of the great Feast of the Saints.&rsquo;</p>
<p id="v1ch5.9">Lastly, I may mention that it is unlucky to say that
you are very well: at any rate, I infer that it is regarded so, as you
will never get a Manxman to say that he is <i>feer vie</i>, &lsquo;very
well.&rsquo; He usually admits that he is &lsquo;middling&rsquo;; and
if by any chance he risks a stronger adjective, he hastens to qualify
it by adding &lsquo;now,&rsquo; or &lsquo;just now,&rsquo; with an
emphasis indicative of his anxiety not to say <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb347" href="#v1pb347" name=
"v1pb347">347</a>]</span>too much. His habits of speech point back to a
time when the Manx mind was dominated by the fear of awaking malignant
influences in the spirit world around him. This has had the effect of
giving the Manx peasant&rsquo;s character a tinge of reserve and
suspicion, which makes it difficult to gain his confidence: his
acquaintance has, therefore, to be cultivated for some time before you
can say that you know the workings of his heart. The pagan belief in a
Nemesis has doubtless passed away, but not without materially affecting
the Manx idea of a personal devil. Ever since the first allusion made
in my hearing by Manxmen to the devil, I have been more and more deeply
impressed that for them the devil is a much more formidable being than
Englishmen or Welshmen picture him. He is a graver and, if I may say
so, a more respectable being, allowing no liberties to be taken with
his name, so you had better not call him a devil, the evil one, or like
names, for his proper designation is <i>Noid ny Hanmey</i>, &lsquo;the
Enemy of the Soul,&rsquo; and in ordinary Anglo-Manx conversation he is
commonly called &lsquo;the Enemy of Souls.&rsquo; I well remember
getting one day into a conversation with an old soldier in the south of
the island. He was, as I soon discovered, labouring under a sort of
theological monomania, and his chief question was concerning the Welsh
word for &lsquo;the Enemy of Souls.&rsquo; I felt at once that I had to
be careful, and that the reputation of my countrymen depended on how I
answered. As I had no name anything like the one he used for the devil,
I explained to him that the Welsh, though not a great nation, were
great students of theology, and that they had by no means neglected the
great branch of it known as satanology. In fact that study, as I went
on to say, had left its impress on the Welsh language: on Sunday the
ministers of all denominations, the deacons <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb348" href="#v1pb348" name=
"v1pb348">348</a>]</span>and elders, and all self-respecting
congregations spoke of the devil trisyllabically as <i>diafol</i>,
while on the other days of the week everybody called him more briefly
and forcibly <i>diawl</i>, except bards concocting an <i>awdl</i> for
an Eiste&#273;fod, where the devil must always be called <i>diafl</i>,
and excepting also sailors, farm servants, post-boys and colliers,
together with country gentlemen learning Welsh to address their
wouldn&rsquo;t-be constituents&mdash;for all these the regulation form
was <i>jawl</i>, with an English <i>j</i>. Thus one could, I pointed
out to him, fix the social standing of a Welshman by the way he named
&lsquo;the Enemy of Souls,&rsquo; as well as appreciate the superiority
of Welsh over Greek, seeing that Welsh, when it borrowed <span class=
"trans" title="diabolos"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&delta;&iota;&#8049;&beta;&omicron;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span></span>
from Greek, quadrupled it, while Greek remained sterile. He was so
profoundly impressed that I never was able to bring his attention back
to the small fry, spiritually speaking, of the Isle of Man, to wit, the
fairies and the fenodyree, or even the witches and the charmers, except
that he had some reserve of faith in witches, since the witch of Endor
was in the Bible and had ascribed to her a &lsquo;terr&rsquo;ble&rsquo;
great power of raising spirits: that, he thought, must be true. I
pointed out to him that a fenodyree (see p. 288) was also mentioned in
his Bible: this display of ready knowledge on my part made a deep
impression on his mind.</p>
<p>The Manx are, as a rule, a sober people, and highly religious; as
regards their tenets, they are mostly members of the Church of England
or Wesleyan Methodists, or else both, which is by no means unusual.
Religious phrases are not rare in their ordinary conversation; in fact,
they struck me as being of more frequent occurrence than in Wales, even
the Wales of my boyhood; and here and there this fondness for religious
phraseology has left its traces on the native vocabulary. Take, for
example, the word for &lsquo;anybody, a person, or human <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb349" href="#v1pb349" name=
"v1pb349">349</a>]</span>being,&rsquo; which Cregeen writes
<i>py&rsquo;agh</i> or <i>p&rsquo;agh</i>: he rightly regards it as the
colloquial pronunciation of <i>peccagh</i>, &lsquo;a sinner.&rsquo; So,
when one knocks at a Manx door and calls out, <i>Vel p&rsquo;agh
sthie</i>? he literally asks, &lsquo;Is there any sinner
indoors?&rsquo; The question has, however, been explained to me, with
unconscious irony, as properly meaning, &lsquo;Is there any Christian
indoors?&rsquo; and care is now taken in reading to pronounce the
middle consonants of the word <i>peccagh</i>, &lsquo;sinner,&rsquo; so
as to distinguish it from the word for a Christian
&lsquo;anybody&rsquo;: but the identity of origin is unmistakable.</p>
<p>Lastly, the fact that a curse is a species of prayer, to wit, a
prayer for evil to follow, is well exemplified in Manx by the same
words, <i>gwee</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e10732src" href=
"#xd26e10732" name="xd26e10732src">14</a>, plural <i>gwecaghyn</i>,
meaning both kinds of prayer. Thus I found myself stumbling several
times, in reading through the Psalms in Manx, from not bearing in mind
the sinister meaning of these words; for example in Psalm xiv. 6, where
we have <i>Ta &rsquo;n beeal oc lane dy ghweeaghyn as dy herriuid</i>,
which I mechanically construed to mean &lsquo;Their mouth is full of
praying and bitterness,&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;cursing and
bitterness&rsquo;; and so in other cases, such as Ps. x. 7, and cix.
27.</p>
<p id="v1ch5.10">It occurred to me on various occasions to make
inquiries as to the attitude of religious Manxmen towards witchcraft
and the charmer&rsquo;s vocation. Nobody, so far as I know, accuses
them of favouring witchcraft in any way whatsoever; but as to the
reality of witches and witchcraft they are not likely to have any
doubts so long as they dwell on the Biblical account of the witch of
Endor, as I have already mentioned in the case of the old Crimean
soldier. Then as to charmers <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb350"
href="#v1pb350" name="v1pb350">350</a>]</span>I have heard it
distinctly stated that the most religious men are they who have most
confidence in charmers and their charms; and a lay preacher whom I know
has been mentioned to me as now and then doing a little charming in
cases of danger or pressing need. On the whole, I think the charge
against religious people of consulting charmers is somewhat
exaggerated; but I believe that recourse to the charmer is more usual
and more openly had than, for example, in Wales, where those who
consult a <i>dyn hyspys</i> or &lsquo;wise man&rsquo; have to do it
secretly, and at the risk of being expelled by their co-religionists
from the <i>Seiet</i> or &lsquo;Society.&rsquo; There is somewhat in
the atmosphere of Man to remind one rather of the Wales of a past
generation&mdash;Wales as it was at the time when the Rev. Edmund Jones
could write a <i>Relation of Apparitions of Spirits in the County of
Monmouth and the Principality of Wales</i>, as a book &lsquo;designed
to confute and to prevent the infidelity of denying the being and
apparition of spirits, which tends to irreligion and atheism&rsquo;:
see pp. 174, 195 above.</p>
<p id="v1ch5.11">The Manx peasantry are perhaps the most independent
and prosperous in the British Isles; but their position geographically
and politically has been favourable to the continuance of ideas not
quite up to the level of the latest papers on Darwinism and Evolution
read at our Church Congresses in this country. This may be thought to
be here wide of the mark; but, after giving, in the previous chapter,
specimens of rather ancient superstitions as recently known in the
island, it is but right that one should form an idea of the
surroundings in which they have lingered into modern times. Perhaps
nothing will better serve to bring this home to the reader&rsquo;s mind
than the fact, for which there is proof, that old people still living
remember men and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb351" href="#v1pb351"
name="v1pb351">351</a>]</span>women clad in white sheets doing penance
publicly in the churches of Man.</p>
<p>The following is the evidence which I was able to find, and I may
state that I first heard in 1888 of the public penance from Mr.
Joughin, who was an aged man and a native of Kirk Bride. He related how
a girl named Mary Dick gave an impertinent answer to the clergyman when
he was catechizing her class, and how she had to do penance for it at
church. She took her revenge on the parson by singing, while attending
in a white sheet, louder than everybody else in the congregation. This,
unless I am mistaken, Mr. Joughin gave me to understand he had heard
from his father. I mentioned the story to a clergyman, who was
decidedly of opinion that no one alive now could remember anything
about public penance. Not long after, however, I got into conversation
with a shoemaker at Kirk Michael, named Dan Kelly, who was nearly
completing his eighty-first year. He was a native of Ballaugh, and
stated that he remembered many successive occupants of the episcopal
see. A long time ago the official called the sumner had, out of spite
he said, appointed him to serve as one of the four of the chapter jury.
It was, he thought, when he was about twenty-five. During his term of
office he saw four persons, of whom two were married men and two
unmarried women, doing penance in the parish church of Ballaugh for
having illegitimate children. They stood in the alley of the church,
and the sumner had to throw white sheets over them; on the fourth
Sunday of their penance they stood inside the chancel rails, but not to
take the communion. The parson, whose name was Stowell or Stowall, made
them thoroughly ashamed of themselves on the fourth Sunday, as one of
the men afterwards admitted. Kelly mentioned the names of the women and
of one of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb352" href="#v1pb352"
name="v1pb352">352</a>]</span>men, and he indicated to me some of their
descendants as well known in the neighbourhood. I cross-examined him
all the more severely, as I had heard the other view of the remoteness
of the date. But nothing could shake Kelly, who added that soon after
the date of the above mentioned cases the civil functionary, known as
the vicar-general, put an end to the chapter jury and to public
penance: according to his reckoning the penance he spoke of must have
taken place about 1832. Another old man, named Kewley, living now near
Kirk Michael, but formerly in the parish of Lezayre, had a similar
story. He thinks that he was born in the sixth year of the century, and
when he was between eighteen and twenty he saw a man doing public
penance, in Lezayre Church, I presume, but I have no decided note on
that point. However that may be, he remembered that the penitent, when
he had done his penance, had the audacity to throw the white sheet over
the sumner, who, the penitent remarked, might now wear it himself, as
he had had enough of it. Kewley would bring the date only down to about
1825.</p>
<p>Lastly, I was in the island again in 1891, and spent the first part
of the month of April at Peel, where I had conversations with a retired
captain who was then about seventy-eight. He is a native of the parish
of Dalby, but he was only &lsquo;a lump of a boy&rsquo; when the last
couple of immorals were forced to do penance in white sheets at church.
He gave me the guilty man&rsquo;s name, and the name of his home in the
parish, and both the captain and his daughter assured me that the man
had only been dead six or seven years; that is, the penitent seems to
have lived till about the year 1884. I may here mention that the parish
of Dalby is the subject of many tales, which go to show that its people
were more old-fashioned in their ways than those of the rest of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb353" href="#v1pb353" name=
"v1pb353">353</a>]</span>island. It appears to have been the last,
also, to be reached by a cart road; and I was amused by a
native&rsquo;s description of the men at Methodist meetings in Dalby
pulling the <i>tappag</i>, or forelock, at the name of Jesus, while the
women ducked a curtsy in a dangerously abrupt fashion. He and his wife
appeared to be quite used to it: the husband was an octogenarian named
Quirc, who was born on the coast near the low-lying peninsula called
the <span class="corr" id="xd26e10775" title=
"Source: Narbyl">Niarbyl</span>, that is to say &lsquo;the
Tail.&rsquo;</p>
<p>To return to the public penance, it seems to us in this country to
belong, so to say, to ancient history, and it transports us to a state
of things which we find it hard to realize. The lapse of years has
brought about profounder changes in our greater Isle of Britain than in
the smaller Isle of Man, while we ourselves, helpless to escape the
pervading influence of those profounder changes, become living
instances of the comprehensive truth of the German poet&rsquo;s
words,</p>

may turn out to be all wrong; for I learn from the Rev. John Quine,
vicar of Malew, in Man, that there is a farm called Balthane or
Bolthane south of Ballasalla, and that in the computus (of 1540) of the
Abbey Tenants it is called <i>Biulthan</i>. This last, if originally a
man&rsquo;s name, would <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb334n" href=

places that out of the question. See also the <i>Lioar Manninagh</i>,

gives the name as <i>Builthan</i> in the boundary <i>inter Cross Jvar

<p class="first">It is only recently<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e10800src" href="#xd26e10800" name="xd26e10800src">1</a> that I
heard for the first time of Welsh instances of the habit of tying rags
and bits of clothing to the branches of a tree growing near a holy
well. Since then I have obtained several items of information in point:
the first is a communication received in June, 1892, from Mr. J. H.
Davies, of Lincoln College, Oxford&mdash;since then of Lincoln&rsquo;s
Inn&mdash;relating to a Glamorganshire holy well, situated near the
pathway leading from Coychurch to Bridgend. It is the custom there, he
states, for people suffering from any malady to dip a rag in the water,
and to bathe the affected part of the body, the rag being then placed
on a tree close to the well. When Mr. Davies passed that way, some
three years previously, there were, he adds, hundreds of such shreds on
the tree, some of which distinctly presented the appearance of having
been very recently placed there. The well is called Ffynnon Cae Moch,
&lsquo;Swine-field Well,&rsquo; which can hardly have been its old
name; and a later communication from Mr. Davies summarizes a
conversation which he had about the well, on December 16, 1892, with
Mr. J. T. Howell, of Pencoed, near Bridgend. His notes run
thus:&mdash;&lsquo;<i>Ffynnon Cae Moch</i>, between Coychurch and
Bridgend, is one <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb355" href="#v1pb355"
name="v1pb355">355</a>]</span>mile from Coychurch, one and a quarter
from Bridgend, near Tremains. It is within twelve or fifteen yards of
the high-road, just where the pathway begins. People suffering from
rheumatism go there. They bathe the part affected with water, and
afterwards tie a piece of rag to the tree which overhangs the well. The
rag is not put in the water at all, but is only put on the tree for
luck. It is a stunted, but very old tree, and is simply <i>covered</i>
with rags.&rsquo; A little less than a year later, I had an opportunity
of visiting this well in the company of Mr. Brynmor-Jones; and I find
in my notes that it is not situated so near the road as Mr. Howell
would seem to have stated to Mr. Davies. We found the well, which is a
powerful spring, surrounded by a circular wall. It is overshadowed by a
dying thorn tree, and a little further back stands another thorn which
is not so decayed: it was on this latter thorn we found the rags. I
took off a twig with two rags, while Mr. Brynmor-Jones counted over a
dozen other rags on the tree; and we noticed that some of them had only
recently been suspended there: among them were portions undoubtedly of
a woman&rsquo;s clothing. At one of the hotels at Bridgend, I found an
illiterate servant who was acquainted with the well, and I
cross-examined him on the subject of it. He stated that a man with a
wound, which he explained to mean a cut, would go and stand in the well
within the wall, and there he would untie the rag that had been used to
tie up the wound and would wash the wound with it: then he would tie up
the wound with a fresh rag and hang the old one on the tree. The more
respectable people whom I questioned talked more vaguely, and only of
tying a rag to the tree, except one who mentioned a pin being thrown
into the well <i>or</i> a rag being tied to the tree.</p>
<p>My next informant is Mr. D. J. Jones, a native of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb356" href="#v1pb356" name=
"v1pb356">356</a>]</span>Rhon&#273;a Valley, in the same county of
Glamorgan. He was an undergraduate of Jesus College, Oxford, when I
consulted him in 1892. His information was to the effect that he knows
of three interesting wells in the county. The first is situated within
two miles of his home, and is known as <i>Ffynnon Pen Rhys</i>, or the
Well of Pen Rhys. The custom there is that the person who wishes his
health to be benefited should wash in the water of the well, and throw
a pin into it afterwards. He next mentions a well at &#7930;ancarvan,
some five or six miles from Cowbridge, where the custom prevails of
tying rags to the branches of a tree growing close at hand. Lastly, he
calls my attention to a passage in <i>Hanes Morganwg</i>, &lsquo;The
History of Glamorgan,&rsquo; written by Mr. D. W. Jones, known in Welsh
literature as Dafy&#273; Morganwg. In that work, p. 29, the author
speaks of <i>Ffynnon Marcros</i>, &lsquo;the Well of Marcros,&rsquo; to
the following effect:&mdash;&lsquo;It is the custom for those who are
healed in it to tie a shred of linen or cotton to the branches of a
tree that stands close by; and there the shreds are, almost as numerous
as the leaves.&rsquo; Marcros is, I may say, near Nash Point, and looks
on the map as if it were about eight miles distant from Bridgend. Let
me here make it clear that so far we have had to do with four different
wells<a class="noteref" id="xd26e10827src" href="#xd26e10827" name=
"xd26e10827src">2</a>, three of which are severally distinguished by
the presence of a tree adorned with rags by those who seek health in
those waters; but they are all three, as the reader will have doubtless
noticed, in the same district, namely, the part of Glamorganshire near
the main line of the Great Western Railway.</p>
<p>There is no reason, however, to think that the custom of tying rags
to a well tree was peculiar to that part of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb357" href="#v1pb357" name=
"v1pb357">357</a>]</span>the Principality. One day, in looking through
some old notes of mine, I came across an entry bearing the date of
August 7, 1887, when I was spending a few days with my friend,
Chancellor Silvan Evans, at &#7930;anwrin Rectory, near
Machyn&#7931;eth. Mrs. Evans was then alive and well, and took a keen
interest in Welsh antiquities and folklore. Among other things, she
related to me how she had, some twenty years before, visited a well in
the parish of &#7930;andri&#7931;o yn Rhos, namely <i>Ffynnon
Eilian</i>, or Elian&rsquo;s Well, between Abergele and &#7930;andudno,
when her attention was directed to some bushes near the well, which had
once been covered with bits of rags left by those who frequented the
well. This was told Mrs. Evans by an old woman of seventy, who, on
being questioned by Mrs. Evans concerning the history of the well,
informed her that the rags used to be tied to the bushes by means of
wool. She was explicit on the point, that wool had to be used for the
purpose, and that even woollen yarn would not do: it had to be wool in
its natural state. The old woman remembered this to have been the rule
ever since she was a child. Mrs. Evans noticed corks, with pins stuck
in them, floating in the well, and her informant remembered many more
in years gone by; for Elian&rsquo;s Well was once in great repute as a
<i>ffynnon reibio</i>, or a well to which people resorted for the
kindly purpose of bewitching those whom they hated. I infer, however,
from what Mrs. Evans was told of the rags, that Elian&rsquo;s Well was
visited, not only by the malicious, but also by the sick and suffering.
My note is not clear on the point whether there were any rags on the
bushes by the well when Mrs. Evans visited the spot, or whether she was
only told of them by the caretaker. Even in the latter case it seems
evident that this habit of tying rags to trees or bushes near sacred
wells has only <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb358" href="#v1pb358"
name="v1pb358">358</a>]</span>ceased in that part of Denbighshire
within this century. It is very possible that it continued in North
Wales more recently than this instance would lead one to suppose;
indeed, I should not be in the least surprised to learn that it is
still practised in out of the way places in Gwyne&#273;, just as it is
in Glamorgan: we want more information.</p>
<p>I cannot say for certain whether it was customary in any of the
cases to which I have called attention to tie rags to the well tree as
well as to throw pins or other small objects into the well; but I
cannot help adhering to the view, that the distinction was probably an
ancient one between two orders of things. In other words, I am inclined
to believe that the rag was regarded as the vehicle of the disease of
which the ailing visitor to the well wished to be rid, and that the
bead, button, or coin deposited by him in the well, or in a receptacle
near the well, formed alone the offering. In opposition to this view
Mr. Gomme has expressed himself as follows in <i>Folk-Lore</i>, 1892,
p. 89:&mdash;&lsquo;There is some evidence against that, from the fact
that in the case of some wells, especially in Scotland at one time, the
whole garment was put down as an offering. Gradually these offerings of
clothes became less and less till they came down to rags. Also in other
parts, the geographical distribution of rag-offerings coincides with
the existence of monoliths and dolmens.&rsquo; As to the monoliths and
dolmens, I am too little conversant with the facts to risk any opinion
as to the value of the coincidence; but as to the suggestion that the
rag originally meant the whole garment, that will suit my hypothesis
admirably. In other words, the whole garment was, as I take it, the
vehicle of the disease: the whole was accursed, and not merely a part.
But Mr. Gomme had previously touched on the question in his
presidential address (<i>Folk-Lore</i> for 1892, p. 13); and I must
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb359" href="#v1pb359" name=
"v1pb359">359</a>]</span>at once admit that he succeeded then in
proving that a certain amount of confusion occurs between things which
I should regard as belonging originally to distinct categories: witness
the inimitable Irish instance which he quotes:&mdash;&lsquo;To St.
Columbkill&mdash;I offer up this button, a bit o&rsquo; the waistband
o&rsquo; my own breeches, an&rsquo; a taste o&rsquo; my wife&rsquo;s
petticoat, in remimbrance of us havin&rsquo; made this holy station;
an&rsquo; may they rise up in glory to prove it for us in the last
day.&rsquo; Here not only the button is treated as an offering, but
also the bits of clothing; but the confusion of ideas I should explain
as being, at least in part, one of the natural results of substituting
a portion of a garment for the entire garment; for thereby a button or
a pin becomes a part of the dress, and capable of being interpreted in
two senses. After all, however, the ordinary practices have not, as I
look at them, resulted in effacing the distinction altogether: the rag
is not left in the well; nor is the bead, button, or pin attached to a
branch of the tree. So, in the main, it seemed to me easier to explain
the facts, taken altogether, on the supposition that originally the rag
was regarded as the vehicle of the disease, and the bead, button, or
coin as the offering. My object in calling attention to this point was
to have it discussed, and I am happy to say that I have not been
disappointed; for, since my remarks were published<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e10855src" href="#xd26e10855" name="xd26e10855src">3</a>, a
paper entitled <i>Pin-wells and Rag-bushes</i> was read before the
British Association by Mr. Hartland, in 1893, and published in
<i>Folk-Lore</i> for the same year, pp. 451&ndash;70. In that paper the
whole question is gone into with searching logic, and Mr. Hartland
finds the required explanation in one of the dogmas of magic. For
&lsquo;if an article of my clothing,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;in a
witch&rsquo;s hands may cause me to suffer, the same article in contact
with a beneficent power may relieve my pain, restore me to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb360" href="#v1pb360" name=
"v1pb360">360</a>]</span>health, or promote my general prosperity. A
pin that has pricked my wart &hellip; has by its contact, by the wound
it has inflicted, acquired a peculiar bond with the wart; the rag that
has rubbed the wart has by that friction acquired a similar bond; so
that whatever is done to the pin or the rag, whatever influences the
pin or the rag may undergo, the same influences are by that very act
brought to bear, upon the wart. If, instead of using a rag, or making a
pilgrimage to a sacred well, I rub my warts with raw meat and then bury
the meat, the wart will decay and disappear with the decay and
dissolution of the meat&#8202;&hellip;. In like manner my shirt or
stocking, or a rag to represent it, placed upon a sacred bush, or
thrust into a sacred well&mdash;my name written upon the walls of a
temple&mdash;a stone or a pellet from my hand cast upon a sacred image
or a sacred cairn&mdash;is thenceforth in continual contact with
divinity; and the effluence of divinity, reaching and involving it,
will reach and involve me.&rsquo; Mr. Hartland concludes from a large
number of instances, that as a rule &lsquo;where the pin or button is
dropped into the well, the patient does not trouble about the rag, and
vice versa.&rsquo; This wider argument as to the effluence of the
divinity of a particular spot of special holiness seems to me
conclusive. It applies also, needless to say, to a large category of
cases besides those in question between Mr. Gomme and the present
writer.</p>
<p>So now I would revise my position thus:&mdash;I continue to regard
the rag much as before, but treat the article thrown into the well as
the more special means of establishing a beneficial relation with the
well divinity: whether it could also be viewed as an offering would
depend on the value attached to it. Some of the following notes may
serve as illustrations, especially those relating to the wool and the
pin:&mdash;<i>Ffynnon <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb361" href=
"#v1pb361" name="v1pb361">361</a>]</span>Gwynwy</i>, or the Well of
Gwynwy, near &#7930;angelynin, on the river Conwy, appears to be partly
in point; for it formerly used to be well stocked with crooked pins,
which nobody would touch lest he might get from them the warts supposed
to attach to them, whence it would appear that a pin might be regarded
as the vehicle of the disease. There was a well of some repute at Cae
Garw, in the parish of Pisty&#7931;, near the foot of Carnguwch, in
&#7930;eyn, or West Carnarvonshire. The water possessed virtues to cure
one of rheumatism and warts; but, in order to be rid of the latter, it
was requisite to throw a pin into the well for each individual wart.
For these two items of information, and several more to be mentioned
presently, I have to thank Mr. John Jones, better known in Wales by his
bardic name of Myr&#273;in Far&#273;, and as an enthusiastic collector
of Welsh antiquities, whether in the form of manuscript or of unwritten
folklore. On the second day of the year 1893 I paid him a visit at
Chwilog, on the Carnarvon and Avon Wen Railway, and asked him many
questions: these he not only answered with the utmost willingness, but
he also showed me the unpublished materials which he had collected. I
come next to a competition on the folklore of North Wales at the London
Eiste&#273;fod in 1887, in which, as one of the adjudicators, I
observed that several of the competitors mentioned the prevalent
belief, that every well with healing properties must have its outlet
towards the south (<i>i&rsquo;r d&ecirc;</i>). According to one of
them, if you wished to get rid of warts, you should, on your way to the
well, look for wool which the sheep had lost. When you had found enough
wool you should prick each wart with a pin, and then rub the wart well
with the wool. The next thing was to bend the pin and throw it into the
well. Then you <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb362" href="#v1pb362"
name="v1pb362">362</a>]</span>should place the wool on the first
whitethorn you could find, and as the wind scattered the wool, the
warts would disappear. There was a well of the kind, the writer went on
to say, near his home; and he, with three or four other boys, went from
school one day to the well to charm their warts away. For he had
twenty-three on one of his hands; so that he always tried to hide it,
as it was the belief that if one counted the warts they would double
their number. He forgets what became of the other boys&rsquo; warts,
but his own disappeared soon afterwards; and his grandfather used to
maintain that it was owing to the virtue of the well. Such were the
words of this writer, whose name is unknown to me; but I guess him to
have been a native of Carnarvonshire, or else of one of the
neighbouring districts of Denbighshire or Merionethshire. To return to
Myr&#273;in Far&#273;, he mentioned <i lang="cy">Ffynnon Cefn
&#7930;eithfan</i>, or the Well of the &#7930;eithfan Ridge, on the
eastern slope of Myny&#273; y Rhiw, in the parish of Bryncroes, in the
west of &#7930;eyn. In the case of this well it is necessary, when
going to it and coming from it, to be careful not to utter a word to
anybody, or to turn to look back. What one has to do at the well is to
bathe the warts with a rag or clout which has grease on it. When that
is done, the clout with the grease has to be carefully concealed
beneath the stone at the mouth of the well. This brings to my mind the
fact that I noticed more than once, years ago, rags underneath stones
in the water flowing from wells in Wales, and sometimes thrust into
holes in the walls of wells, but I had no notion how they came
there.</p>
<p>On the subject of pin-wells I had in 1893, from Mr. T. E. Morris, of
Portmadoc, barrister-at-law, some account of <i>Ffynnon Faglan</i>, or
Baglan&rsquo;s Well, in the parish of &#7930;anfaglan, near Carnarvon.
The well is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb363" href="#v1pb363"
name="v1pb363">363</a>]</span>situated in an open field to the right of
the road leading towards the church, and close to it. The church and
churchyard form an enclosure in the middle of the same field, and the
former has in its wall the old stone reading <span class="sc">FILI
LOVERNII ANATEMORI</span>. My friend derived information from Mrs.
Roberts, of Cefn y Coed, near Carnarvon, as follows:&mdash;&lsquo;The
old people who would be likely to know anything about <i>Ffynnon
Faglan</i> have all died. The two oldest inhabitants, who have always
lived in this parish of &#7930;anfaglan, remember the well being used
for healing purposes. One told me his mother used to take him to it,
when he was a child, for sore eyes, bathe them with the water, and then
drop in a pin. The other man, when he was young, bathed in it for
rheumatism; and until quite lately people used to fetch away the water
for medicinal purposes. The latter, who lives near the well, at Tan y
Graig, said that he remembered it being cleaned out about fifty years
ago, when two basinfuls of pins were taken out, but no coin of any
kind. The pins were all bent, and I conclude the intention was to
exorcise the evil spirit supposed to afflict the person who dropped
them in, or, as the Welsh say, <i>dadwitsio</i>. No doubt some ominous
words were also used. The well is at present nearly dry, the field
where it lies having been drained some years ago, and the water in
consequence withdrawn from it. It was much used for the cure of warts.
The wart was washed, then pricked with a pin, which, after being bent,
was thrown into the well. There is a very large and well-known well of
the kind at C&rsquo;lynnog, <i>Ffynnon Beuno</i>, &ldquo;St.
Beuno&rsquo;s Well,&rdquo; which was considered to have miraculous
healing powers; and even yet, I believe, some people have faith in it.
<i>Ffynnon Faglan</i> is, in its construction, an imitation, on a
smaller scale, of St. Beuno&rsquo;s Well at C&rsquo;lynnog.&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb364" href="#v1pb364" name=
"v1pb364">364</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the cliffs at the west end of &#7930;eyn is a wishing-well called
<i>Ffynnon Fair</i>, or St. Mary&rsquo;s Well, to the left of the site
of Eglwys Fair, and facing Ynys En&#7931;i, or Bardsey. Here, to obtain
your wish, you have to descend the steps to the well and walk up again
to the top with your mouth full of the water; and then you have to go
round the ruins of the church once or more times with the water still
in your mouth. Viewing the position of the well from the sea, I should
be disposed to think that the realization of one&rsquo;s wish at that
price could not be regarded as altogether cheap. Myr&#273;in Far&#273;
also told me that there used to be a well near Criccieth Church. It was
known as <i>Ffynnon y Saint</i>, or the Saints&rsquo; Well, and it was
the custom to throw keys or pins into it on the morning of Easter
Sunday, in order to propitiate St. Catherine, who was the patron of the
well. I should be glad to know what this exactly meant.</p>
<p>Lastly, a few of the wells in that part of Gwyne&#273; may be
grouped together and described as oracular. One of these, the big well
in the parish of &#7930;anbedrog in &#7930;eyn, as I learn from
Myr&#273;in Far&#273;, required the devotee to kneel by it and avow his
faith in it. When this had been duly done, he might proceed in this
wise: to ascertain, for instance, the name of the thief who had stolen
from him, he had to throw a bit of bread into the well and name the
person whom he suspected. At the name of the thief the bread would
sink; so the inquirer went on naming all the persons he could think of
until the bit of bread sank, when the thief was identified. How far is
one to suppose that we have here traces of the influences of the water
ordeal common in the Middle Ages? Another well of the same kind was
<i>Ffynnon Saethon</i>, in &#7930;anfihangel Bache&#7931;aeth parish,
also in &#7930;eyn. Here it was customary, as he had it in writing,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb365" href="#v1pb365" name=
"v1pb365">365</a>]</span>for lovers to throw pins (<i>pinnau</i>) into
the well; but these pins appear to have been the points of the
blackthorn. At any rate, they cannot well have been of any kind of
metal, as we are told that, if they sank in the water, one concluded
that one&rsquo;s lover was not sincere in his or her love.</p>
<p>Next may be mentioned a well, bearing the remarkable name of
<i>Ffynnon Gwyne&#273;</i>, or the Well of Gwyned, which is situated
near Myny&#273; Mawr, in the parish of Abererch: it used to be
consulted in the following manner:&mdash;When it was desired to
discover whether an ailing person would recover, a garment of his would
be thrown into the well, and according to the side on which it sank it
was known whether he would live or die.</p>
<p><i>Ffynnon Gybi</i>, or St. Cybi&rsquo;s Well, in the parish of
&#7930;angybi, was the scene of a somewhat similar practice; for there,
girls who wished to know their lovers&rsquo; intentions would spread
their pocket-handkerchiefs on the water of the well, and, if the water
pushed the handkerchiefs to the south&mdash;in Welsh <i>i&rsquo;r
d&ecirc;</i>&mdash;they knew that everything was right&mdash;in Welsh
<i>o &#273;&ecirc;</i>&mdash;and that their lovers were honest and
honourable in their intentions; but, if the water shifted the
handkerchiefs northwards, they concluded the contrary. A reference to
this is made by a modern Welsh poet, as follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">

<p class="first">The spot is not far from where Myr&#273;in Far&#273;
lives; and he mentioned, that adjoining the well is a building which
was probably intended for the person in charge <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb366" href="#v1pb366" name=
"v1pb366">366</a>]</span>of the well: it has been tenanted within his
memory. Not only for this but also for several of the foregoing items
of information am I indebted to Myr&#273;in; and now I come to Mrs.
Williams-Ellis, of Glasfryn Uchaf, who tells me that one day not long
ago, she met at &#7930;angybi a native who had not visited the place
since his boyhood: he had been away as an engineer in South Wales
nearly all his life, but had returned to see an aged relative. So the
reminiscences of the place filled his mind, and, among other things, he
said that he remembered very well what concern there was one day in the
village at a mischievous person having taken a very large eel out of
the well. Many of the old people, he said, felt that much of the virtue
of the well was probably taken away with the eel. To see it coiling
about their limbs when they went into the water was a good sign: so he
gave one to understand. As a sort of parallel I may mention that I have
seen the fish living in <i>Ffynnon Beris</i>, not far from the parish
church of &#7930;anberis. It is jealously guarded by the inhabitants,
and when it was once or twice taken out by a mischievous stranger he
was forced to put it back again. However, I never could get the history
of this sacred fish, but I found that it was regarded as very
old<a class="noteref" id="xd26e10986src" href="#xd26e10986" name=
"xd26e10986src">5</a>. I may add that it appears the well <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb367" href="#v1pb367" name=
"v1pb367">367</a>]</span>called <i>Ffynnon Fair</i>,
&lsquo;Mary&rsquo;s Well,&rsquo; at &#7930;an&#273;wyn, in Anglesey,
used formerly to have inhabiting it a sacred fish, whose movements
indicated the fortunes of the love-sick men and maidens who visited
there the shrine of St. Dwynwen<a class="noteref" id="xd26e11025src"
href="#xd26e11025" name="xd26e11025src">6</a>. Possibly inquiry would
result in showing that such sacred fish have been far more common once
in the Principality than they are now.</p>
<p>The next class of wells to claim our attention consists of what I
may call fairy wells, of which few are mentioned in connexion with
Wales; but the legends about them are of absorbing interest. One of
them is in Myr&#273;in Far&#273;&rsquo;s neighbourhood, and I
questioned him a good deal on the subject: it is called <i>Ffynnon
Grassi</i>, or Grace&rsquo;s Well, and it occupies, according to him, a
few square feet&mdash;he has measured it himself&mdash;of the
south-east corner of the lake of Glasfryn Uchaf, in the parish of
&#7930;angybi. It appears that it was walled in, and that the stone
forming its eastern side has several holes in it, which were intended
to let water enter the well and not issue from it. It had a door or
cover on its surface; and it was necessary to keep the door always
shut, except when water was being drawn. Through somebody&rsquo;s
negligence, however, it was once on a time left open: the consequence
was that the water <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb368" href=
"#v1pb368" name="v1pb368">368</a>]</span>of the well flowed out and
formed the Glasfryn Lake, which is so considerable as to be navigable
for small boats. Grassi is supposed in the locality to have been the
name of the owner of the well, or at any rate of a lady who had
something to do with it. <i>Grassi</i>, or Grace, however, can only be
a name which a modern version of the legend has introduced. It probably
stands for an older name given to the person in charge of the well; to
the one, in fact, who neglected to shut the door; but though the name
must be comparatively modern, the story, as a whole, does not appear to
be at all modern, but very decidedly the contrary.</p>
<p>So I wrote in 1893; but years after my conversation with Myr&#273;in
Far&#273;, my attention was called to the fact that the Glasfryn
family, of which the Rev. J. C. Williams-Ellis is the head, have in
their coat of arms a mermaid, who is represented in the usual way,
holding a comb in her right hand and a mirror in her left. I had from
the first expected to find some kind of Undine or Liban story
associated with the well and the lake, though I had abstained from
trying the risky effects of leading questions; but when I heard of the
heraldic mermaid I wrote to Mr. Williams-Ellis to ask whether he knew
her history. His words, though not encouraging as regards the mermaid,
soon convinced me that I had not been wholly wrong in supposing that
more folklore attached to the well and lake than I had been able to
discover. Since then Mrs. Williams-Ellis has taken the trouble of
collecting on the spot all the items of tradition which she could find:
she communicated them to me in the month of March, 1899, and the
following is an abstract of them, preceded by a brief description of
the ground:&mdash;</p>
<p>The well itself is at the foot of a very green field-bank at the
head of the lake, but not on the same level <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb369" href="#v1pb369" name=
"v1pb369">369</a>]</span>with it, as the lake has had its waters
lowered half a century or more ago by the outlet having been cut
deeper. Adjoining the field containing the well is a larger field,
which also slopes down to the lake and extends in another direction to
the grounds belonging to the house. This larger field is called
Cae&rsquo;r Ladi, &lsquo;the Lady&rsquo;s Field,&rsquo; and it is
remarkable for having in its centre an ancient standing stone, which,
as seen from the windows of the house, presents the appearance of a
female figure hurrying along, with the wind slightly swelling out her
veil and the skirt of her dress. Mr. Williams-Ellis remembers how when
he was a boy the stone was partially white-washed, and how an old
bonnet adorned the top of this would-be statue, and he thinks that an
old shawl used to be thrown over the shoulders.</p>
<p>Now as to Grassi, she is mostly regarded as a ghostly person somehow
connected with the lake and the house of Glasfryn. One story is to the
effect, that on a certain evening she forgot to close the well, and
that when the gushing waters had formed the lake, poor Grassi, overcome
with remorse, wandered up and down the high ground of Cae&rsquo;r Ladi,
moaning and weeping. There, in fact, she is still at times to be heard
lamenting her fate, especially at two o&rsquo;clock in the early
morning. Some people say that she is also to be seen about the lake,
which is now the haunt of some half a dozen swans. But on the whole her
visits appear to have been most frequent and troublesome at the house
itself. Several persons still living are mentioned, who believe that
they have seen her there, and two of them, Mrs. Jones of Talafon, and
old Sydney Griffith of Ty&#273;yn Bach, agree in the main in their
description of what they saw, namely, a tall lady with well marked
features and large bright eyes: she was dressed in white silk and a
white velvet bonnet. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb370" href=
"#v1pb370" name="v1pb370">370</a>]</span>The woman, Sydney Griffith,
thought that she had seen the lady walking several times about the
house and in Cae&rsquo;r Ladi. This comes, in both instances, from a
young lady born and bred in the immediate neighbourhood, and studying
now at the University College of North Wales; but Mrs. Williams-Ellis
has had similar accounts from other sources, and she mentions tenants
of Glasfryn who found it difficult to keep servants there, because they
felt that the place was haunted. In fact one of the tenants himself
felt so unsafe that he used to take his gun and his dog with him to his
bedroom at night; not to mention that when the Williams-Ellises lived
themselves, as they do still, in the house, their visitors have been
known to declare that they heard the strange plaintive cry out of doors
at two o&rsquo;clock in the morning.</p>
<p>Traces also of a very different story are reported by Mrs.
Williams-Ellis, to the effect that when the water broke forth to form
the lake, the fairies seized Grassi and changed her into a swan, and
that she continued in that form to live on the lake sixscore years, and
that when at length she died, she loudly lamented her lot: that cry is
still to be heard at night. This story is in process apparently of
being rationalized; at any rate the young lady student, to whom I have
referred, remembers perfectly that her grandfather used to explain to
her and the other children at home that Grassi was changed into a swan
as a punishment for haunting Glasfryn, but that nevertheless the old
lady still visited the place, especially when there happened to be
strangers in the house. At the end of September last Mrs. Rhys and I
had the pleasure of spending a few days at Glasfryn, in the hope of
hearing the plaintive wail, and of seeing the lady in white silk
revisiting her familiar haunts. But alas! our sleep was never once
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb371" href="#v1pb371" name=
"v1pb371">371</a>]</span>disturbed, nor was our peace once troubled by
suspicions of anything uncanny. This, however, is negative, and
characterized by the usual weakness of all such evidence.</p>
<p>It is now time to turn to another order of facts: in the first place
may be mentioned that the young lady student&rsquo;s grandmother used
to call the well <i>Ffynnon Gr&acirc;s Si&ocirc;n Gruffu&#273;</i>, as
she had always heard that Gr&acirc;s was the daughter of a certain
Si&ocirc;n Gruffy&#273;, &lsquo;John Griffith,&rsquo; who lived near
the well; and Mrs. Williams-Ellis finds that Gr&acirc;s was buried, at
a very advanced age, on December 14, 1743, at the parish church of
&#7930;angybi, where the register describes her as <i>Grace Jones,
alias Grace Jones Griffith</i>. She had lived till the end at Glasfryn,
but from documents in the possession of the Glasfryn family it is known
that in 1728 Hugh Lloyd of Tra&#7931;wyn purchased the house and estate
of Glasfryn from a son of Grace&rsquo;s, named <i>John ab
Cadwaladr</i>, and that Hugh Lloyd of Tra&#7931;wyn&rsquo;s son, the
Rev. William Lloyd, sold them to Archdeacon Ellis, from whom they have
descended to the Rev. J. C. Williams-Ellis. In the light of these facts
there is no reason to connect the old lady&rsquo;s name very closely
with the well or the lake. She was once the dominant figure at
Glasfryn, that is all; and when she died she was as usual supposed to
haunt the house and its immediate surroundings; and if we might venture
to suppose that Glasfryn was sold by her son against her will, though
subject to conditions which enabled her to remain in possession of the
place to the day of her death, we should have a further explanation,
perhaps, of her supposed moaning and lamentation.</p>
<p>In the background, however, of the story, one detects the
possibility of another female figure, for it may be that the standing
stone in Cae&rsquo;r Ladi represents a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb372" href="#v1pb372" name="v1pb372">372</a>]</span>woman buried
there centuries before Grace ruled at Glasfryn, and that traditions
about the earlier lady have survived to be inextricably mixed with
those concerning the later one. Lastly, those traditions may have also
associated the subject of them with the well and the lake; but I wish
to attach no importance to this conjecture, as we have in reserve a
third figure of larger possibilities than either Grace or the stone
woman. It needs no better introduction than Mrs. Williams-Ellis&rsquo;
own words: &lsquo;Our younger boys have a crew of three little Welsh
boys who live near the lake, to join them in their boat sailing about
the pool and in camping on the island, &amp;c. They asked me once who
<i>Morgan</i> was, whom the little boys were always saying they were to
be careful against. An old man living at Tal &#7930;yn,
&ldquo;Lake&rsquo;s End,&rdquo; a farm close by, says that as a boy he
was always told that &ldquo;naughty boys would be carried off by Morgan
into the lake.&rdquo; Others tell me that Morgan is always held to be
ready to take off troublesome children, and somehow Morgan is thought
of as a bad one.&rsquo; Now as Morgan carries children off into the
pool, he would seem to issue from the pool, and to have his home in it.
Further, he plays the same part as the fairies against whom a
Snowdonian mother used to warn her children: they were on no account to
wander away from the house when there was a mist, lest the fairies
should carry them to their home beneath &#7930;yn Dwythwch. In other
words, Morgan may be said to act in the same way as the mermaid, who
takes a sailor down to her submarine home; and it explains to my mind a
discussion which I once heard of the name Morgan by a party of men and
women making hay one fine summer&rsquo;s day in the neighbourhood of
Ponterwyd, in North Cardiganshire. I was a child, but I remember
vividly how they teased one of their number whose <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb373" href="#v1pb373" name=
"v1pb373">373</a>]</span>&lsquo;style&rsquo; was Morgan. They hinted at
dreadful things associated with the name; but it was all so vague that
I could not gather that his great unknown namesake was a thief, a
murderer, or any kind of ordinary criminal. The impression left on my
mind was rather the notion of something weird, uncanny, or non-human;
and the fact that the Welsh version of the Book of Common Prayer calls
the Pelagians <i>Morganiaid</i>, &lsquo;Morgans,&rsquo; does not offer
an adequate explanation. But I now see clearly that it is to be sought
in the indistinct echo of such folklore as that which makes Morgan a
terror to children in the neighbourhood of the Glasfryn Lake.</p>
<p>The name, however, presents points of difficulty which require some
notice: the Welsh translators of Article IX in the Prayer Book were
probably wrong in making <i>Pelagians</i> into <i>Morganiaid</i>, as
the Welsh for <i>Pelagius</i> seems to have been rather
<i>Morien</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e11094src" href="#xd26e11094"
name="xd26e11094src">7</a>, which in its oldest recorded form was
<i>Morgen</i>, and meant sea-born, or offspring of the sea. In a still
earlier form it must have been <i>Morigenos</i>, with a feminine
<i>Morigena</i>, but when the endings came to be dropped both vocables
would become <i>Morgen</i>, later <i>Mori&#815;en</i>. I do not
remember coming across a feminine <i>Morgen</i> in Welsh, but the
presumption is that it did exist. For, among other things, I may
mention that we have it in Irish as <i>Muirgen</i>, one of the names of
the lake lady Liban, who, when the waters of the neglected well rushed
forth to form Lough Neagh, lived beneath that lake until she desired to
be changed into a salmon. The same conclusion may be drawn from the
name <i>Morgain</i> or <i>Morgan</i>, given in the French romances to
one or more water ladies; for those names are easiest to explain as the
Brythonic <i>Morgen</i> borrowed from a Welsh or Breton source, unless
one found it possible to trace it direct to the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb374" href="#v1pb374" name=
"v1pb374">374</a>]</span>Goidels of Wales. No sooner, however, had the
confusion taken place between Morgen and the name which is so common in
Wales as exclusively a man&rsquo;s name, than the aquatic figure must
also become male. That is why the Glasfryn Morgan is now a male, and
not a female like the other characters whose r&ocirc;le he plays. But
while the name was in Welsh successively <i>Morgen</i> and
<i>Morien</i>, the man&rsquo;s name was <i>Morcant</i>, <i>Morgant</i>,
or <i>Morgan</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e11154src" href=
"#xd26e11154" name="xd26e11154src">8</a>, so that, phonologically
speaking, no confusion could be regarded as possible between the two
series. Here, therefore, one detects the influence, doubtless, of the
French romances which spoke of a lake lady Morgain, Morgan, or Morgue.
The character varied: Morgain le Fay was a designing and wicked person;
but Morgan was also the name of a well disposed lady of the same fairy
kind, who took Arthur away to be healed at her home in the Isle of
Avallon. We seem to be on the track of the same confusing influence of
the name, when it occurs in the story of Geraint and Enid; for there
the chief physician of Arthur&rsquo;s court is called Morgan Tut or
Morgant Tut, and the word <i>tut</i> has been shown by M. Loth to have
meant the same sort of non-human being whom an eleventh-century Life of
St. Maudez mentions as <i>quidam d&aelig;mon quem Britones</i> Tuthe
<i>appellant</i>. Thus the name <i>Morgan Tut</i> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb375" href="#v1pb375" name=
"v1pb375">375</a>]</span>is meant as the Welsh equivalent of the French
<i lang="fr">Morgain le Fay</i> or <i lang="fr">Morgan la
F&eacute;e</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e11227src" href="#xd26e11227"
name="xd26e11227src">9</a>; but so long as the compiler of the story of
Geraint and Enid employed in his Welsh the form Morgan, he had
practically no choice but to treat the person called Morgan as a man,
whether that was or was not the sex in the original texts on which he
was drawing. Of course he could have avoided the difficulty in case he
was aware of it, if he had found some available formula in use like
<i>Mary-Morgant</i>, said to be a common name for a fairy on the island
of Ouessant, off the coast of Brittany.</p>
<p>Summarizing the foregoing notes, we seem to be right in drawing the
following conclusions:&mdash;(1) The well was left in the charge of a
woman who forgot to shut it, and when she saw the water bursting forth,
she bewailed her negligence, as in the case of her counterpart in the
legend of Cantre&rsquo;r Gwaelod. (2) The original name of the Glasfryn
&lsquo;Morgan&rsquo; was Morgen, later Morien. (3) The person changed
into a swan on the occasion of the Glasfryn well erupting was not
Grassi, but most probably Morgen. And (4) the character was originally
feminine, like that of the mermaid or the fairies, whose r&ocirc;le the
Glasfryn Morgan plays; and more especially may one compare the Irish
Muirgen, the <i>Morgen</i> more usually called L&iacute;ban. For it is
to be noticed that when the neglected well burst forth she, Muirgen or
L&iacute;ban, was not drowned like the others <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb376" href="#v1pb376" name=
"v1pb376">376</a>]</span>involved in the calamity, but lived in her
chamber at the bottom of the lake formed by the overflowing well, until
she was changed into a salmon. In that form she lived on some three
centuries, until in fact she was caught in the net of a fisherman, and
obtained the boon of a Christian burial. However, the change into a
swan is also known on Irish ground: take for instance the story of the
Children of Lir, who were converted into swans by their stepmother, and
lived in that form on Loch Dairbhreach, in Westmeath, for three hundred
years, and twice as long on the open sea, until their destiny closed
with the advent of St. Patrick and the first ringing of a Christian
bell in Erin<a class="noteref" id="xd26e11282src" href="#xd26e11282"
name="xd26e11282src">10</a>.</p>
<p>The next legend was kindly communicated to me by Mr. Wm. Davies
already mentioned at p. 147 above: he found it in <i>Cyfai&#7931; yr
Aelwyd</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e11292src" href="#xd26e11292"
name="xd26e11292src">11</a>, &ldquo;The Friend of the Hearth,&rdquo;
where it is stated that it belonged to David Jones&rsquo; <i>Storehouse
of Curiosities</i>, a collection which does not seem to have ever
assumed the form of a printed book. David Jones, of Trefriw, in the
Conwy Valley, was a publisher and poet who wrote between 1750 and 1780.
This is his story: &lsquo;In 1735 I had a conversation with a man
concerning Tegid Lake. He had heard from old people that near the
middle of it there was a well opposite &#7930;angower, and the well was
called <i>Ffynnon Gywer</i>, &ldquo;Cower&rsquo;s Well,&rdquo; and at
that time the town was round about the well. It was obligatory to place
a lid on the well every night. (It seems that in those days somebody
was aware that unless this was done it would prove the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb377" href="#v1pb377" name=
"v1pb377">377</a>]</span>destruction of the town.) But one night it was
forgotten, and by the morning, behold the town had subsided and the
lake became three miles long and one mile wide. They say, moreover,
that on clear days some people see the chimneys of the houses. It is
since then that the town was built at <i>the lower end of the lake</i>.
It is called <i>Y Bala</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e11315src" href=
"#xd26e11315" name="xd26e11315src">12</a>, and the man told me that he
had talked with an old Bala man who had, when he was a youth, had two
days&rsquo; mowing of hay<a class="noteref" id="xd26e11390src" href=
"#xd26e11390" name="xd26e11390src">13</a> between the road and the
lake; but by this time the lake had spread over that land and the road
also, which necessitated the purchase of land further away for the
road; and some say that the town will yet sink as far as the place
called &#7930;anfor&mdash;others call it &#7930;anfaw&#273;,
&ldquo;Drown-church,&rdquo; or &#7930;anfawr,
&ldquo;Great-church,&rdquo; in Pen&#7931;yn&#8202;&hellip;. Further,
when the weather is stormy water appears oozing through every floor
within Bala, and at other times anybody can get water enough for the
use of his house, provided he dig a little into the floor of
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In reference to the idea that the town is to sink, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb378" href="#v1pb378" name=
"v1pb378">378</a>]</span>together with the neighbouring village of
&#7930;anfor, the writer quotes in a note the couplet known still to
everybody in the neighbourhood as follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>Y Bala aeth, a&rsquo;r Bala aiff,</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>A &#7930;anfor aiff yn &#7930;yn.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Bala old the lake has had, and Bala new</p>
<p class="line">The lake will have, and &#7930;anfor too.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">This probably implies that old Bala is beneath the
lake, and that the present Bala is to meet the like fate at some time
to come. This kind of prophecy is not very uncommon: thus there has
been one current as to the Montgomeryshire town of Pool, called, in
Welsh, Tra&#7931;wng or Tra&#7931;wm, and in English, Welshpool, to
distinguish it from the English town of Pool. As to Welshpool, a very
deep water called &#7930;yn Du, lying between the town and the
<i>Caste&#7931; Coch</i> or Powys Castle, and right in the domain of
the castle, is suddenly to spread itself, and one fine market day to
engulf the whole place<a class="noteref" id="xd26e11436src" href=
"#xd26e11436" name="xd26e11436src">14</a>. Further, when I was a boy in
North Cardiganshire, the following couplet was quite familiar to me,
and supposed to have been one of Merlin&rsquo;s prophecies:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>Caer Fyr&#273;in, cei oer fore;</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>Daear a&rsquo;th lwnc, dw&rsquo;r i&rsquo;th
le.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Carmarthen, a cold morn awaits thee;</p>
<p class="line">Earth gapes, and water in thy place will be.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">In regard to the earlier half of the line, concerning
Bala gone, the story of Ffynnon Gywer might be said to explain it, but
there is another which is later and far better known. It is of the same
kind as the stories <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb379" href=
"#v1pb379" name="v1pb379">379</a>]</span>related in Welsh concerning
&#7930;ynclys and Syfa&#273;on; but I reserve it with these and others
of the same sort for chapter vii.</p>
<p>For the next legend belonging here I have to thank the Rev. J.
Fisher, a native of the parish of &#7930;andyb&iuml;e, who, in spite of
his name, is a genuine Welshman, and&mdash;what is more&mdash;a Welsh
scholar. The following are his words:&mdash;&lsquo;&#7930;yn &#7930;ech
Owen (the last word is locally sounded <i>w-en</i>, like <i>oo-en</i>
in English, as is also the personal name Owen) is on Myny&#273; Mawr,
in the ecclesiastical parish of Gors L&acirc;s, and the civil parish of
&#7930;anarthney, Carmarthenshire. It is a small lake, forming the
source of the Gwendraeth Fawr. I have heard the tradition about its
origin told by several persons, and by all, until quite recently,
pretty much in the same form. In 1884 I took it down from my
grandfather, Rees Thomas (<i>b.</i> 1809, <i>d.</i> 1892), of Cil
Co&#7931; &#7930;andeb&iuml;e&mdash;a very intelligent man, with a good
fund of old-world Welsh lore&mdash;who had lived all his life in the
neighbouring parishes of &#7930;andeilo Fawr and
&#7930;andyb&iuml;e.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The following is the version of the story (translated) as I
had it from him:&mdash;There was once a man of the name of Owen living
on Myny&#273; Mawr, and he had a well, &ldquo;<i lang=
"cy">ffynnon</i>.&rdquo; Over this well he kept a large flag
(&ldquo;<i lang="cy">fflagen neu lech fawr</i>&rdquo;: &ldquo;<i lang=
"cy">fflagen</i>&rdquo; is the word in common use now in these parts
for a large flat stone), which he was always careful to replace over
its mouth after he had satisfied himself or his beast with water. It
happened, however, that one day he went on horseback to the well to
water his horse, and forgot to put the flag back in its place. He rode
off leisurely in the direction of his home; but, after he had gone some
distance, he casually looked back, and, to his great astonishment, he
saw that the well had burst out and was overflowing the whole place. He
suddenly bethought him that he should ride <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb380" href="#v1pb380" name=
"v1pb380">380</a>]</span>back and encompass the overflow of the water
as fast as he could; and it was the horse&rsquo;s track in galloping
round the water that put a stop to its further overflow. It is fully
believed that, had he not galloped round the flood in the way he did,
the well would have been sure to inundate the whole district and drown
all. Hence the lake was called the Lake of Owen&rsquo;s Flag,
&ldquo;<i lang="cy">&#7930;yn &#7930;ech Owen</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have always felt interested in this story, as it resembled
that about the formation of Lough Neagh, &amp;c.; and, happening to
meet the Rev. D. Harwood Hughes, B.A., the vicar of Gors L&acirc;s (St.
&#7930;eian&rsquo;s), last August (1892), I asked him to tell me the
legend as he had heard it in his parish. He said that he had been told
it, but in a form different from mine, where the &ldquo;Owen&rdquo; was
said to have been Owen Glyndwr. This is the substance of the legend as
he had heard it:&mdash;Owen Glyndwr, when once passing through these
parts, arrived here of an evening. He came across a well, and, having
watered his horse, placed a stone over it in order to find it again
next morning. He then went to lodge for the night at Dy&#7931;goed
Farm, close by. In the morning, before proceeding on his journey, he
took his horse to the well to give him water, but found to his surprise
that the well had become a lake.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Fisher goes on to mention the later history of the lake: how,
some eighty years ago, its banks were the resort on Sunday afternoons
of the young people of the neighbourhood, and how a Baptist preacher
put an end to their amusements and various kinds of games by preaching
at them. However, the lake-side appears to be still a favourite spot
for picnics and Sunday-school gatherings. Mr. Fisher was quite right in
appending to his own version that of his friend; but, from the point of
view of folklore, I must confess that I can make <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb381" href="#v1pb381" name=
"v1pb381">381</a>]</span>nothing of the latter: it differs from the
older one as much as chalk does from cheese. It would be naturally
gratifying to the pride of local topography to be able to connect with
the pool the name of Owen Glyndwr; but it is worthy of note that this
highly respectable attempt to rationalize the legend wholly fails, as
it does not explain why there is now a lake where there was once but a
well. In other words, the euhemerized story is itself evidence
corroborative of Mr. Fisher&rsquo;s older version, which is furthermore
kept in countenance by Howells&rsquo; account, p. 104, where we are
told who the Owen in question was, namely, Owen Lawgoch, a personage
dear, as we shall see later, to the Welsh legend of the district. He
and his men had their abode in a cave on the northern side of
Myny&#273; Mawr, and while there Owen used, we are informed, to water
his steed at a fine spring covered with a large stone, which it
required the strength of a giant to lift. But one day he forgot to
replace it, and when he next sought the well he found the lake. He
returned to his cave and told his men what had happened. Thereupon both
he and they fell into a sleep, which is to last till it is broken by
the sound of a trumpet and the clang of arms on Rhiw Goch: then they
are to sally forth to conquer.</p>
<p>Now the story as told by Howells and Fisher provokes comparison, as
the latter suggests, with the Irish legend of the formation of Lough
Ree and of Lough Neagh in the story of the Death of Eochaid
McMaireda<a class="noteref" id="xd26e11525src" href="#xd26e11525" name=
"xd26e11525src">15</a>. In both <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb382"
href="#v1pb382" name="v1pb382">382</a>]</span>of these legends also
there is a horse, a kind of water-horse, who forms the well which
eventually overflows and becomes Lough Ree, and so with the still
larger body of water known as Lough Neagh. In the latter case the fairy
well was placed in the charge of a woman; but she one day left the
cover of the well open, and the catastrophe took place&mdash;the water
issued forth and overflowed the country. One of Eochaid&rsquo;s
daughters, named L&iacute;ban, however, was not drowned, but only
changed into a salmon as already mentioned at p. 376 above. In my
<i>Arthurian Legend</i>, p. 361, I have attempted to show that the name
<i>L&iacute;ban</i> may have its Welsh equivalent in that of
<i>&#7930;&iuml;on</i>, occurring in the name of <i>&#7930;yn
&#7930;&iuml;on</i>, or &#7930;&iuml;on&rsquo;s Lake, the bursting of
which is described in the latest series of Triads, iii. 13, 97, as
causing a sort of deluge. I am not certain as to the nature of the
relationship between those names, but it seems evident that the stories
have a common substratum, though it is to be noticed that no well,
fairy or otherwise, figures in the &#7930;yn &#7930;&iuml;on legend,
which makes the presence of the monster called the afanc the cause of
the waters bursting forth. So Hu the Mighty, with his team of famous
oxen, is made to drag the afanc out of the lake.</p>
<p>There is, however, another Welsh legend concerning a great overflow
in which a well does figure: I allude to that of <i>Cantre&rsquo;r
Gwaelod</i>, or the Bottom Hundred, a fine spacious country supposed to
be submerged in Cardigan Bay. Modern euhemerism treats it as defended
by embankments and sluices, which, we are told, were in the charge of
the prince of the country, named Seithennin, who, being one day in his
cups, forgot to shut the sluices, and thus brought about the
inundation, which was the end of his fertile realm. This, however, is
not the old legend: that speaks of a well, and lays the blame on a
woman&mdash;a pretty sure sign of antiquity, as <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb383" href="#v1pb383" name=
"v1pb383">383</a>]</span>the reader may judge from other old stories
which will readily occur to him. The Welsh legend to which I allude is
embodied in a short poem in the <i>Black Book of
Carmarthen</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e11580src" href="#xd26e11580"

<p class="first">The names in these lines present great difficulties:
first comes that of <i>Mererid</i>, which is no other word than
<i>Margarita</i>, &lsquo;a pearl,&rsquo; borrowed; but what does it
here mean? <i>Margarita</i>, besides meaning a pearl, was used in
Welsh, e.g. under the form <i>Marereda</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e11856src" href="#xd26e11856" name="xd26e11856src">18</a>, as the
proper name written in English <i>Margaret</i>. That is probably how it
is to be taken here, namely, as the name given to the negligent
guardian of the fairy well. It cannot very well be, however, the name
belonging to the original form of the legend; and we have the somewhat
parallel case of <i>Ffynnon Grassi</i>, or Grace&rsquo;s Well; but what
old Celtic name that of Mererid has replaced in the story, I cannot
say. In the next place, nobody has been able to identify <i>Caer
Kenedyr</i>, and I have nothing to say as to <i>Mor Maurhidic</i>,
except that a person of that name is mentioned in another of the
Englynion of the Graves. It runs thus in the <i>Black Book</i>, fol.
33<sup>a</sup>:&mdash;</p>

</div>
<p class="first">The last name in the final triplet of the poem which I
have attempted to translate is <i>Kinran</i>, which is otherwise
unknown as a Welsh name; but I am inclined to identify it with that of
one of the three who escaped the catastrophe in the Irish legend. The
name there is <i>Curn&aacute;n</i>, which was borne by the idiot of the
family, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb385" href="#v1pb385" name=
"v1pb385">385</a>]</span>who, like many later idiots, was at the same
time a prophet. For he is represented as always prophesying that the
waters were going to burst forth, and as advising his friends to
prepare boats. So he may be set, after a fashion, over against our
<i>Seithenhin synhuir vann</i>, &lsquo;S. of the feeble mind.&rsquo;
But one might perhaps ask why I do not point out an equivalent in Irish
for the Welsh Seithennin, as his name is now pronounced. The fact is
that no such equivalent occurs in the Irish story in question, nor
exactly, so far as I know, in any other.</p>
<p>That is what I wrote when penning these notes; but it has occurred
to me since then, that there is an Irish name, an important Irish name,
which looks as if related to <i>Seithenhin</i>, and that is <i>Setanta
Beg</i>, &lsquo;the little Setantian,&rsquo; the first name of the
Irish hero C&uacute;chulainn. The <i>nt</i>, I may point out, makes one
suspect that <i>Setanta</i> is a name of Brythonic origin in Irish; and
I have been in the habit of associating it with that of the people of
the Setantii<a class="noteref" id="xd26e11929src" href="#xd26e11929"
name="xd26e11929src">19</a>, placed by Ptolemy on the coast of what is
now Lancashire. Whether any legend has ever been current about a
country submerged on the coast of Lancashire I cannot say, but the
soundings would make such a legend quite comprehensible. I remember,
however, reading somewhere as to the Plain of Muirthemhne, of which
C&uacute;chulainn, our Setanta Beg, had special charge, that it was so
called because it had once been submarine and become since the
converse, so to say, of Seithennin&rsquo;s country. The latter is
beneath Cardigan Bay, while the other fringed the opposite side of the
sea, consisting as it did of the level portion of County Louth. On the
whole, I am not altogether indisposed to believe that we have here
traces of an ancient legend <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb386"
href="#v1pb386" name="v1pb386">386</a>]</span>of a wider scope than is
represented by the <i>Black Book</i> triplets, which I have essayed to
translate. I think that I am right in recognizing that legend in the
<i>Mabinogi</i> of Branwen, daughter of &#7930;yr. There we read that,
when Br&acirc;n and his men crossed from Wales to Ireland, the
intervening sea consisted merely of two navigable rivers, called
&#7930;i and Archan. The story-teller adds words to the effect, that it
is only since then the sea has multiplied its realms<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e11944src" href="#xd26e11944" name="xd26e11944src">20</a>
between Ireland and <i>Ynys y Kedyrn</i>, or the Isle of the Keiri, a
name which has already been discussed: see pp. 279&ndash;83.</p>
<p>These are not all the questions which such stories suggest; for
Seithennin is represented in later Welsh literature as the son of one
<i>Seithyn</i>, associated with Dyfed; and the name <i>Seithyn</i>
leads off to the coast of Brittany. For I learn from a paper by the
late M. le Men, in the <i lang="fr">Revue Arch&eacute;ologique</i> for
1872 (xxiii. 52), that the &Icirc;le de Sein is called in Breton
<i>Enez-Sun</i>, in which <i>Sun</i> is a dialectic shortening of
<i>Sizun</i>, which is also met with as <i>Seidhun</i>. That being so,
one would seem to be right in regarding Sizun as nearly related to our
<i>Seithyn</i>. That is not all&mdash;the tradition reminds one of the
Welsh legend: M. le Men refers to the <i>Vie du P. Maunoir</i> by
Boschet (Paris, 1697) p. 126, and adds that, in his own time, the road
ending on the Pointe du Raz opposite the &Icirc;le de Sein passed
&lsquo;<span lang="fr">pour &ecirc;tre l&rsquo;ancien chemin qui
conduisait &agrave; la ville d&rsquo;Is (<i>Kaer-a-Is</i>, la ville de
la partie basse)</span>.&rsquo; It is my own experience, that nobody
can go about much in Brittany without hearing over and over again about
the submerged city of Is. There is no doubt that we have in these names
distant echoes of an inundation story, once widely current in both
Britains and perhaps also in Ireland. With regard to Wales we have an
indication <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb387" href="#v1pb387" name=
"v1pb387">387</a>]</span>to that effect in the fact, that Gwy&#273;no,
to whom the inundated region is treated as having belonged, is
associated not only with Cardigan Bay, but also with the coast of North
Wales, especially the part of it situated between Bangor and
&#7930;andudno<a class="noteref" id="xd26e11995src" href="#xd26e11995"
name="xd26e11995src">21</a>. Adjoining it is supposed to lie submerged
a once fertile district called Tyno Helig, a legend about which will
come under notice later. This brings the inundation story nearer to the
coast where Ptolemy in the second century located the Harbour of the
Setantii, about the mouth of the river Ribble, and in their name we
seem to have some sort of a historical basis for that of the drunken
Seithennin<a class="noteref" id="xd26e12001src" href="#xd26e12001"
name="xd26e12001src">22</a>. I cannot close these remarks better than
by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb388" href="#v1pb388" name=
"v1pb388">388</a>]</span>appending what Professor Boyd Dawkins has
recently said with regard to the sea between Britain and
Ireland:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It may be interesting to remark further that during the time
of the Iberian dominion in Wales, the geography of the seaboard was
different to what it is now. A forest, containing the remains of their
domestic oxen that had run wild, and of the indigenous wild animals
such as the bear and the red deer, united Anglesey with the mainland,
and occupied the shallows of Cardigan Bay, known in legend as
&ldquo;the lost lands of Wales.&rdquo; It extended southwards from the
present sea margin across the estuary of the Severn, to Somerset,
Devon, and Cornwall. It passed northwards across the Irish Sea off the
coast of Cheshire and Lancashire, and occupied Morecambe Bay with a
dense growth of oak, Scotch fir, alder, birch, and hazel. It ranged
seawards beyond the ten-fathom line, and is to be found on most
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb389" href="#v1pb389" name=
"v1pb389">389</a>]</span>shores beneath the sand-banks and mud-banks,
as for example at Rhyl and Cardiff. In Cardigan Bay it excited the
wonder of Giraldus de Barri<a class="noteref" id="xd26e12190src" href=
"#xd26e12190" name="xd26e12190src">23</a>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>To return to fairy wells, I have to confess that I cannot decide
what may be precisely the meaning of the notion of a well with a woman
set carefully to see that the door or cover of the well is kept shut.
It will occur, however, to everybody to compare the well which Undine
wished to have kept shut, on account of its affording a ready access
from her subterranean country to the residence of her refractory knight
in his castle above ground. And in the case of the Glasfryn Lake, the
walling and cover that were to keep the spring from overflowing were,
according to the story, not water-tight, seeing that there were holes
made in one of the stones. This suggests the idea that the cover was to
prevent the passage of some such full-grown fairies as those with which
legend seems to have once peopled all the pools and tarns of Wales.
But, in the next place, is the maiden in charge of the well to be
regarded as priestess of the well? The idea of a priesthood in
connexion with wells in Wales is not wholly unknown.</p>
<p>I wish, however, before discussing these instances, to call
attention to one or two Irish ones which point in another direction.
Foremost may be mentioned the source of the river Boyne, which is now
called Trinity Well, situated in the Barony of Carbury, in County
Kildare. The following is the Rennes <i>Dindsenchas</i> concerning it,
as translated by Dr. Stokes, in the <i>Revue Celtique</i>, xv.
315&ndash;6:&mdash;&lsquo;B&oacute;and, wife of Necht&aacute;n son of
Labraid, went to the secret well which was in the green of S&iacute;d
Necht&aacute;in. Whoever went to it would not come <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb390" href="#v1pb390" name=
"v1pb390">390</a>]</span>from it without his two eyes bursting, unless
it were Necht&aacute;n himself and his three cup-bearers, whose names
were Flesc and L&aacute;m and Luam. Once upon a time B&oacute;and went
through pride to test the well&rsquo;s power, and declared that it had
no secret force which could shatter her form, and thrice she walked
withershins round the well. (Whereupon) three waves from the well break
over her and deprive her of a thigh [? <i>wounded her thigh</i>] and
one of her hands and one of her eyes. Then she, fleeing her shame,
turns seaward, with the water behind her as far as Boyne-mouth, (where
she was drowned).&rsquo; This is to explain why the river is called
<i>B&oacute;and</i>, &lsquo;Boyne.&rsquo; A version to the same effect
in the <i>Book of Leinster</i>, fol. 191<sup>a</sup>, makes the general
statement that no one who gazed right into the well could avoid the
instant ruin of his two eyes or otherwise escape with impunity. A
similar story is related to show how the Shannon, in Irish
<i>Sinann</i>, <i>Sinand</i>, or <i>Sinend</i>, is called after a woman
of that name. It occurs in the same Rennes manuscript, and the
following is Stokes&rsquo; translation in the <i>Revue Celtique</i>,
xv. 457:&mdash;&lsquo;Sinend, daughter of Lodan Lucharglan son of Ler
out of Tir Tairngire (Land of Promise, Fairyland), went to
Connla&rsquo;s Well, which is under sea, to behold it. That is a well
at which are the hazels and inspirations (?) of wisdom, that is, the
hazels of the science of poetry, and in the same hour their fruit and
their blossom and their foliage break forth, and these fall on the well
in the same shower, which raises on the water a royal surge of purple.
Then the salmon chew the fruit, and the juice of the nuts is apparent
on their purple bellies. And seven streams of wisdom spring forth and
turn there again. Now Sinend went to seek the inspiration, for she
wanted nothing save only wisdom. She went with the stream till she
reached <i>Linn Mna Feile</i>, &ldquo;the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb391" href="#v1pb391" name="v1pb391">391</a>]</span>Pool of the
Modest Woman,&rdquo; that is Bri Ele&mdash;and she went ahead on her
journey; but the well left its place, and she followed it<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e12246src" href="#xd26e12246" name=
"xd26e12246src">24</a> to the banks of the river
<i>Tarr-c&aacute;in</i>, &ldquo;Fair-back.&rdquo; After this it
overwhelmed her, so that her back (<i>tarr</i>) went upwards, and when
she had come to the land on this side (of the Shannon) she tasted
death. Whence <i>Sinann</i> and <i>Linn Mna Feile</i> and
<i>Tarr-cain</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In these stories the reader will have noticed that the foremost
punishment on any intruder who looked into the forbidden well was the
instant ruin of his two eyes. One naturally asks why the eyes are made
the special objects of the punishment, and I am inclined to think the
meaning to have originally been that the well or spring was regarded as
the eye of the divinity of the water. Should this prove well founded it
looks natural that the eyes, which transgressed by gazing into the eye
of the divinity, should be the first objects of that divinity&rsquo;s
vengeance. This is suggested to me by the fact that the regular Welsh
word for the source of a river is <i>&#7931;ygad</i>, Old Welsh
<i>licat</i>, &lsquo;eye,&rsquo; as for instance in the case of
<i>Licat Amir</i> mentioned by Nennius, &sect; 73; of <i>&#7930;ygad
&#7930;ychwr</i>, &lsquo;the source of the Loughor river&rsquo; in the
hills behind Carreg Cennen Castle; and of the weird lake in which the
Rheidol<a class="noteref" id="xd26e12279src" href="#xd26e12279" name=
"xd26e12279src">25</a> rises near the top of Plinlimmon: it is called
<i>&#7930;yn &#7930;ygad y Rheidol</i>, &lsquo;the Lake of the
Rheidol&rsquo;s Eye.&rsquo; By the way, the Rheidol is not wholly
without its folklore, for I used to be told in my childhood, that she
and the Wye and the Severn sallied forth simultaneously from Plinlimmon
one fine morning <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb392" href="#v1pb392"
name="v1pb392">392</a>]</span>to run a race to the sea. The result was,
one was told, that the Rheidol won great honour by reaching the sea
three weeks before her bigger sisters. Somebody has alluded to the
legend in the following lines:&mdash;</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="first">To return to the Irish legends, I may mention that
Eugene O&rsquo;Curry has a good deal to say of the mysterious nuts and
&lsquo;the salmon of knowledge,&rsquo; the partaking of which was
synonymous with the acquisition of knowledge and wisdom: see his
<i>Manners and Customs of the Ancient Irish</i>, ii. 142&ndash;4. He
gives it as his opinion that Connla&rsquo;s Well was situated somewhere
in Lower Ormond; but the locality of this Helicon, with the seven
streams of wisdom circulating out of it and back again into it, is more
intelligible when regarded as a matter of fairy geography. A portion of
the note appended to the foregoing legend by Stokes is in point here:
he traces the earliest mention of the nine hazels of wisdom, growing at
the heads of the chief rivers of Ireland, to the Dialogue of the Two
Sages in the <i>Book of Leinster</i>, fol. 186<sup>b</sup>, whence he
cites the poet N&eacute;de mac Adnai saying whence he had come, as
follows:&mdash;<i>a caillib .i. a n&oacute;i collaib na Segsa &hellip;
a caillib didiu assa mbenaiter clessa na s&uacute;ad tanacsa</i>,
&lsquo;from hazels, to wit, from the nine hazels of the Segais &hellip;
from hazels out of which are obtained the feats of the sages, I have
come.&rsquo; The relevancy of this passage will be seen when I add,
that Segais was one of the names of the mound in which the Boyne rises;
so it may be safely inferred that B&oacute;and&rsquo;s transgression
was of the same nature as that of Sinand, to wit, that of intruding on
sacred ground in quest of wisdom and inspiration which <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb393" href="#v1pb393" name=
"v1pb393">393</a>]</span>was not permitted their sex: certain sources
of knowledge, certain <i>quellen</i>, were reserved for men alone.</p>
<p>Before I have done with the Irish instances I must append one in the
form it was told me in the summer of 1894: I was in Meath and went to
see the remarkable chambered cairns on the hill known as <i>Sliabh na
Caillighe</i>, &lsquo;the Hag&rsquo;s Mountain,&rsquo; near Oldcastle
and Lough Crew. I had as my guide a young shepherd whom I picked up on
the way. He knew all about the hag after whom the hill was called
except her name: she was, he said, a giantess, and so she brought
there, in three apronfuls, the stones forming the three principal
cairns. As to the cairn on the hill point known as Belrath, that is
called the Chair Cairn from a big stone placed there by the hag to
serve as her seat when she wished to have a quiet look on the country
round. But usually she was to be seen riding on a wonderful pony she
had: that creature was so nimble and strong that it used to take the
hag at a leap from one hill-top to another. However, the end of it all
was that the hag rode so hard that the pony fell down, and that both
horse and rider were killed. The hag appears to have been <i>Cailleach
Bh&eacute;ara</i>, or <i>Caillech B&eacute;rre</i>, &lsquo;the Old
Woman of Beare,&rsquo; that is, Bearhaven, in County Cork<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e12349src" href="#xd26e12349" name=
"xd26e12349src">26</a>. Now the view <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb394" href="#v1pb394" name="v1pb394">394</a>]</span>from the
Hag&rsquo;s Mountain is very extensive, and I asked the shepherd to
point out some places in the distance. Among other things we could see
Lough Ramor, which he called the Virginia Water, and more to the west
he identified Lough Sheelin, about which he had the following legend to
tell:&mdash;A long, long time ago there was no lake there, but only a
well with a flagstone kept over it, and everybody would put the flag
back after taking water out of the well. But one day a woman who
fetched water from it forgot to replace the stone, and the water burst
forth in pursuit of the luckless woman, who fled as hard as she could
before the angry flood. She continued until she had run about seven
miles&mdash;the estimated length of the lake at the present day. Now at
this point a man, who was busily mowing hay in the field through which
she was running, saw what was happening and mowed the woman down with
his scythe, whereupon the water advanced no further. Such was the
shepherd&rsquo;s yarn, which partly agrees with the Boyne and Shannon
stories in that the woman was pursued by the water, which only stopped
where she died. On the other hand, it resembles the &#7930;yn
&#7930;ech Owen legend and that of Lough Neagh in placing to the
woman&rsquo;s charge only the neglect to cover the well. It looks as if
we had in these stories a confusion of two different institutions, one
being a well of wisdom which no woman durst visit without fatal
vengeance overtaking her, and the other a fairy well which was attended
to by a woman who was to keep it covered, and who may, perhaps, be
regarded as priestess of the spring. If we try to interpret the
Cantre&rsquo;r Gwaelod story from these two points of view we have to
note the following matters:&mdash;Though it is not said that the
<i>moruin</i>, or damsel, had a lid or cover on the well, the word
<i>golligaut</i> or <i>helligaut</i>, &lsquo;did let run,&rsquo;
implies some such an idea <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb395" href=
"#v1pb395" name="v1pb395">395</a>]</span>as that of a lid or door; for
opening the sluices, in the sense of the later version, seems to me out
of the question. In two of the Englynion she is cursed for the action
implied, and if she was the well minister or well servant, as I take
<i>finaun wenestir</i> to mean, we might perhaps regard her as the
priestess of that spring. On the other hand, the prevailing note in the
other Englynion is the <i>traha</i>, &lsquo;presumption, arrogance,
insolence, pride,&rsquo; which forms the burden of four out of five of
them. This would seem to point to an attitude on the part of the damsel
resembling that of B&oacute;and or Sinand when prying into the secrets
of wells which were tabu to them. The seventh Englyn alludes to wines,
and its burden is <i>gormo&#273;</i>, &lsquo;too much, excess,
extravagance,&rsquo; whereby the poet seems to lend countenance to some
such a later story as that of Seithennin&rsquo;s intemperance.</p>
<p>Lastly, the question of priest or priestess of a sacred well has
been alluded to once or twice, and it may be perhaps illustrated on
Welsh ground by the history of Ffynnon Eilian, or St. Elian&rsquo;s
Well, which has been mentioned in another context, p. 357 above. Of
that well we read as follows, s. v. <i>&#7930;andri&#7931;o</i>, in the
third edition of Lewis&rsquo; <i>Topographical Dictionary of
Wales</i>:&mdash;&lsquo;Fynnon Elian, &hellip; even in the present age,
is frequently visited by the superstitious, for the purpose of invoking
curses upon the heads of those who have grievously offended them, and
also of supplicating prosperity to themselves; but the numbers are
evidently decreasing. The ceremony is performed by the applicant
standing upon a certain spot near the well, whilst the owner of it
reads a few passages of the sacred Scriptures, and then, taking a small
quantity of water, gives it to the former to drink, and throws the
residue over his head, which is repeated three times, the party
continuing to mutter imprecations <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb396" href="#v1pb396" name="v1pb396">396</a>]</span>in whatever
terms his vengeance may dictate.&rsquo; Rice Rees, in his <i>Essay on
the Welsh Saints</i> (London, 1836), p. 267, speaks of St. Elian as
follows: &lsquo;Miraculous cures were lately supposed to be performed
at his shrine at &#7930;anelian, Anglesey; and near to the church of
&#7930;anelian, Denbighshire, is a well called Ffynnon Elian, which is
thought by the peasantry of the neighbourhood to be endued with
miraculous powers even at present.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Foulkes, s. v. <i>Elian</i>, in his <i>Enwogion Cymru</i>, published
in Liverpool in 1870, expresses the opinion that the visits of the
superstitious to the well had ceased for some time. The last person
supposed to have had charge of the well was a certain John Evans, but
some of the most amusing stories of the shrewdness of the caretaker
refer to a woman who had charge of the well before Evans&rsquo; time. A
series of articles on <i>Ffynnon Eilian</i> appeared in 1861 in a Welsh
periodical called <i>Y Nofely&#273;</i>, printed by Mr. Aubrey at
&#7930;anerch y Me&#273;, in Anglesey. The articles in question were
afterwards published, I am told, as a shilling book, which I have not
seen, and they dealt with the superstition, with the history of John
Evans, and with his confessions and conversion. I have searched in vain
for any account in Welsh of the ritual followed at the well. When Mrs.
Silvan Evans visited the place, the person in charge of the well was a
woman, and Peter Roberts, in his <i>Cambrian Popular Antiquities</i>,
published in London in 1815, alludes to her or a predecessor of hers in
the following terms, p. 246:&mdash;&lsquo;Near the Well resided some
worthless and infamous wretch, who officiated as priestess.&rsquo; He
furthermore gives one to understand that she kept a book in which she
registered the name of each evil wisher for a trifling sum of money.
When this had been done, a pin was dropped into the well in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb397" href="#v1pb397" name=
"v1pb397">397</a>]</span>the name of the victim. This proceeding looks
adequate from the magical point of view, though less complicated than
the ritual indicated by Lewis. This latter writer calls the person who
took charge of the well the owner; and I have always understood that,
whether owner or not, he or she used to receive gifts, not only for
placing in the well the names of men who were to be cursed, but also
from those men for taking their names out again, so as to relieve them
from the malediction. In fact, the trade in curses seems to have been a
very thriving one: its influence was powerful and widespread.</p>
<p>Here there is, I think, very little doubt that the owner or guardian
of the well was, so to say, the representative of an ancient priesthood
of the well. That priesthood dated its origin probably many centuries
before a Christian church was built near the well, and coming down to
later times we have unfortunately no sufficient data to show how the
right to such priesthood was acquired, whether by inheritance or
otherwise; but we know that a woman might have charge of St.
Elian&rsquo;s Well.</p>
<p>Let me cite another instance, which I unexpectedly discovered some
years ago in the course of a ramble in quest of early inscriptions.
Among other places which I visited was &#7930;andeilo &#7930;wydarth,
near Maen Clochog, in the northern part of Pembrokeshire. This is one
of the many churches bearing the name of St. Teilo in South Wales: the
building is in ruins, but the churchyard is still used, and contains
two of the most ancient post-Roman inscriptions in the Principality. If
you ask now for &lsquo;&#7930;andeilo&rsquo; in this district, you will
be understood to be inquiring after the farm house of that name, close
to the old church; and I learnt from the landlady that her family had
been there for many generations, though they have not very long been
the proprietors of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb398" href=
"#v1pb398" name="v1pb398">398</a>]</span>the land. She also told me of
St. Teilo&rsquo;s Well, a little above the house: she added that it was
considered to have the property of curing the whooping-cough. I asked
if there was any rite or ceremony necessary to be performed in order to
derive benefit from the water. Certainly, I was told: the water must be
lifted out of the well and given to the patient to drink by some member
of the family. To be more accurate, I ought to say that this must be
done by somebody born in the house. Her eldest son, however, had told
me previously, when I was busy with the inscriptions, that the water
must be given to the patient by the heir, not by anybody else. Then
came my question how the water was lifted, or out of what the patient
had to drink, to which I was answered that it was out of the skull.
&lsquo;What skull?&rsquo; said I. &lsquo;St. Teilo&rsquo;s
skull,&rsquo; was the answer. &lsquo;Where do you get the saint&rsquo;s
skull?&rsquo; I asked. &lsquo;Here it is,&rsquo; was the answer, and I
was given it to handle and examine. I know next to nothing about
skulls; but it struck me that it was the upper portion of a thick,
strong skull, and it called to my mind the story of the three churches
which contended for the saint&rsquo;s corpse. That story will be found
in the <i>Book of &#7930;an D&acirc;v</i>, pp. 116&ndash;7, and
according to it the contest became so keen that it had to be settled by
prayer and fasting. So, in the morning, lo and behold! there were three
corpses of St. Teilo&mdash;not simply one&mdash;and so like were they
in features and stature that nobody could tell which were the corpses
made to order and which the old one. I should have guessed that the
skull which I saw belonged to the former description, as not having
been much thinned by the owner&rsquo;s use of it; but this I am
forbidden to do by the fact that, according to the legend, this
particular &#7930;andeilo was not one of the three contending churches
which bore away in triumph <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb399" href=
"#v1pb399" name="v1pb399">399</a>]</span>a dead Teilo each. The reader,
perhaps, would like to take another view, namely, that the story has
been edited in such a way as to reduce a larger number of Teilos to
three, in order to gratify the Welsh weakness for triads.</p>
<p>Since my visit to the neighbourhood I have been favoured with an
account of the well as it is now current there. My informant is Mr.
Benjamin Gibby of &#7930;angolman Mill, who writes mentioning, among
other things, that the people around call the well <i>Ffynnon yr
Ychen</i>, or the Oxen&rsquo;s Well, and that the family owning and
occupying the farm house of &#7930;andeilo have been there for
centuries. Their name, which is Melchior (pronounced Melshor), is by no
means a common one in the Principality, so far as I know; but, whatever
may be its history in Wales, the bearers of it are excellent Kymry. Mr.
Gibby informs me that the current story solves the difficulty as to the
saint&rsquo;s skull as follows:&mdash;The saint had a favourite maid
servant from the Pembrokeshire &#7930;andeilo: she was a beautiful
woman, and had the privilege of attending on the saint when he was on
his death-bed. As his end was approaching he gave his maid a strict and
solemn command that in a year&rsquo;s time from the day of his burial
at &#7930;andeilo Fawr, in Carmarthenshire, she was to take his skull
to the other &#7930;andeilo, and to leave it there to be a blessing to
coming generations of men, who, when ailing, would have their health
restored by drinking water out of it. So the belief prevailed that to
drink out of the skull some of the water of Teilo&rsquo;s Well ensured
health, especially against the whooping-cough. The faith of some of
those who used to visit the well was so great in its efficacy, that
they were wont to leave it, he says, with their constitutions
wonderfully improved; and he mentions a story related to him by an old
neighbour, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb400" href="#v1pb400" name=
"v1pb400">400</a>]</span>Stifyn Ifan, who has been dead for some years,
to the effect that a carriage, drawn by four horses, came once, more
than half a century ago, to &#7930;andeilo. It was full of invalids
coming from Pen Claw&#273;, in Gower, Glamorganshire, to try the water
of the well. They returned, however, no better than they came; for
though they had drunk of the well, they had neglected to do so out of
the skull. This was afterwards pointed out to them by somebody, and
they resolved to make the long journey to the well again. This time
they did the right thing, we are told, and departed in excellent
health.</p>
<p>Such are the contents of Mr. Gibby&rsquo;s Welsh letter; and I would
now only point out that we have here an instance of a well which was
probably sacred before the time of St. Teilo: in fact, one would
possibly be right in supposing that the sanctity of the well and its
immediate surroundings was one of the causes why the site was chosen by
a Christian missionary. But consider for a moment what has happened:
the well paganism has annexed the saint, and established a belief
ascribing to him the skull used in the well ritual. The landlady and
her family, it is true, neither believe in the efficacy of the well,
nor take gifts from those who visit the well; but they continue, out of
kindness, as they put it, to hand the skull full of water to any one
who perseveres in believing in it. In other words, the faith in the
well continues in a measure intact, while the walls of the church have
long fallen into utter decay. Such is the great persistence of some
primitive beliefs; and in this particular instance we have a succession
which seems to point unmistakably to an ancient priesthood of a sacred
spring.</p>

writing the above remarks the following paragraph, purporting to be
copied from the <i>Liverpool Mercury</i> for November 18, 1896,
appeared in the <i lang="la">Arch&aelig;ologia Cambrensis</i> for 1899,
p. 334:&mdash;&lsquo;Two new fishes have just been put in the
&ldquo;Sacred Well,&rdquo; Ffynnon y Sant, at Tyn y Ffynnon, in the
village of Nant Peris, &#7930;anberis. Invalids in large numbers came,
during the last century and the first half of the present century, to
this well to drink of its &ldquo;miraculous waters&rdquo;; and the oak
box, where the contributions of those who visited the spot were kept,
is still in its place at the side of the well. There have always been
two &ldquo;sacred fishes&rdquo; in this well; and there is a tradition
in the village to the effect that if one of the Tyn y Ffynnon fishes
came out of its hiding-place when an invalid took some of the water for
drinking or for bathing purposes, cure was certain; but if the fishes
remained in their den, the water would do those who took it no good.
Two fishes only are to be put in the well at a time, and they generally
live in its waters for about half a century. If one dies before the
other, it would <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb367n" href=
"#v1pb367n" name="v1pb367n">367</a>]</span>be of no use to put in a new
fish, for the old fish would not associate with it, and it would die.
The experiment has been tried. The last of the two fishes put in the
well about fifty years ago died last August. It had been blind for some
time previous to its death. When taken out of the water it measured
seventeen inches, and was buried in the garden adjoining the well. It
is stated in a document of the year 1776 that the parish clerk was to
receive the money put in the box of the well by visitors. This money,
together with the amount of 6<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, was his annual
stipend.&rsquo; Tyn y Ffynnon means &lsquo;the Tenement of the
Well,&rsquo; <i>tyn</i> being a shortened form of <i>ty&#273;yn</i>,
&lsquo;a tenement,&rsquo;as mentioned at p. 33 above; but the mapsters
make it into <i>ty&rsquo;n</i> = <i>ty yn</i>, &lsquo;a house
in,&rsquo; so that the present instance, <i>Ty&rsquo;n y Ffynnon</i>,
could only mean &lsquo;the House in the Well,&rsquo; which, needless to
say, it is not. But one would like to know whether the house and land
were once held rent-free on condition that the tenant took care of the
sacred fish.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

Judging from the three best-known instances, <i>y bala</i> meant the
outlet of a lake: I allude to this <i>Bala</i> at the outlet of
&#7930;yn Tegid; <i>Pont y Bala</i>, &lsquo;the Bridge of the
<i>bala</i>,&rsquo; across the water flowing from the Upper into the
Lower Lake at &#7930;anberis; and <i>Bala Deulyn</i>, &lsquo;the
<i>bala</i> of two lakes,&rsquo; at Nant&#7931;e. Two places called
<i>Bryn y Bala</i> are mentioned s. v. <i>Bala</i> in Morris&rsquo;
<i>Celtic Remains</i>, one near Aberystwyth, at a spot which I have
never seen, and the other near the lower end of the Lower Lake of
&#7930;anberis, as to which it has been suggested to me that it is an
error for <i>Bryn y Bela</i>. It is needless to say that <i>bala</i>
has nothing to do with the Anglo-Irish <i>bally</i>, of such names as
<i>Ballymurphy</i> or <i>Ballynahunt</i>: this vocable is in English
<i>bailey</i>, and in South Wales <i>beili</i>, &lsquo;a farm yard or
enclosure,&rsquo; all three probably from the late Latin <i>balium</i>
or <i>ballium</i>, &lsquo;<span lang="la">locus palis munitus et

<i>bally</i>: they go as far as <i>Balaklava</i> and, probably,

is <i>Tra&#7931;wng &#7930;ywelyn</i>, so called after a &#7930;ywelyn
descended from Cune&#273;a, and supposed to have established a

sight it would seem as if <i>Tra&#7931;wng</i> had something to do with
a lake or piece of water. But there is a Tra&#7931;wng, for instance,

to drown the whole locality but for a miracle performed by St. Patrick
to arrest the flow of its waters. A similar story of a well bursting

In the <i>Iolo MSS.</i>, p. 89, <i>finaun wenestir</i> is made into
<i>Ffynon-Wenestr</i> and said to be one of the ornamental epithets of
the sea; but I am convinced that it should be rather treated as
<i>ffynnon fenestr</i> with <i>wenestir</i> or <i>fenestr</i> mutated
from <i>menestr</i>, which meant a servant, attendant, cup-bearer: for
one or two instances see Pughe&rsquo;s <i>Dictionary</i>. The word is

not profess to see my way through the difficulties which the probable
etymological connexion between the names Setantii, Setanta, Seithyn,
and Seithennin implies. But parts of the following string of guesses
may be found to hold good:&mdash;<i>Seithyn</i> is probably more
correct than <i>Seithin</i>, as it rhymes with <i>cristin</i> =
<i>Cristyn</i> (in <i>Cristynogaeth</i>: see Silvan Evans&rsquo;
<i>Geiriadur</i>, s. v., and Skene&rsquo;s <i>Four Ancient Books</i>,
ii. 210); and it might be assumed to be from the same stem as
<i>Seizun</i>; but, supposing it to represent an earlier
<i>Seithynt</i>, it would equate phonologically with <i>Setanta</i>,
better <i>Setinte</i>, of which the genitive <i>Setinti</i> actually
occurs, as a river name, in the <i>Book of the Dun Cow</i>, fo.
125<sup>b</sup>: see my <i>Hibbert Lectures</i>, p. 455, and see also
the <i>Revue Celtique</i>, xi. 457. It would mean some such an early
form <i>Setn&#805;ti&#815;o-s</i>, and <i>Seithenhin</i>, another
derivative from the same stem, <i>Setn&#805;t&#299;no-s</i>. But the
retention of <i>n</i> before <i>t</i> in <i>Setinte</i> proves it not
to be unconnected with <i>Seithyn</i>, but borrowed from some Brythonic
dialect when the latter was pronounced <i>Seithn&#805;ti&#815;o-s</i>.
If this be anywhere nearly right one has to assume that the manuscripts
of Ptolemy giving the genitive plural as <span class="trans" title=
"Setanti&#333;n"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&Sigma;&epsilon;&tau;&alpha;&nu;&tau;&#8055;&omega;&nu;</span></span>
or <span class="trans" title="Seganti&#333;n"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&Sigma;&epsilon;&gamma;&alpha;&nu;&tau;&#8055;&omega;&nu;</span></span>
should have read <span class="trans" title=
"Sektanti&#333;n"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&Sigma;&epsilon;&kappa;&tau;&alpha;&nu;&tau;&#8055;&omega;&nu;</span></span>,
unless one should rather conjecture <span class="trans" title=
"Segtanti&#333;n"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&Sigma;&epsilon;&gamma;&tau;&alpha;&nu;&tau;&#8055;&omega;&nu;</span></span>
with <i>cht</i> represented by <i>gt</i> as in Ogams in Pembrokeshire:
witness <i>Ogtene</i> and <i>Maqui Quegte</i>. This conjecture as to
the original reading would suggest that the name was derived from the
seventh numeral <i>sechtn&#805;</i>, just as that of the Galloway
people of the <i>Novant&aelig;</i> seems to be from the ninth numeral.
Ptolemy&rsquo;s next entry to the Harbour of the Setantii is the
estuary of the Belisama, supposed to be the Mersey; and next comes the
estuary of the <span class="trans" title="Seteia"><span class="Greek"
lang="grc">&Sigma;&epsilon;&tau;&epsilon;&#8055;&alpha;</span></span>
or <span class="trans" title="Segeia"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&Sigma;&epsilon;&gamma;&epsilon;&#8055;&alpha;</span></span>,
supposed to be the Dee. Now the country of the Setantii, when they had
a country, may have reached from their harbour near the mouth of the
Ribble to the Seteia or the Dee without the name Seteia or Segeia
having anything to do with their own, except that it may have
influenced the latter in the manuscripts of Ptolemy&rsquo;s text. Then
we possibly have a representative of <i>Seteia</i> or <i>Segeia</i> in
the <i>Saidi</i> or <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb388n" href=
"#v1pb388n" name="v1pb388n">388</a>]</span><i>Seidi</i>, sometimes
appended to Seithyn&rsquo;s name. In that case <i>Seithyn Saidi</i>, in
the late Triad iii. 37, would mean Seithyn of Seteia, or the Dee. A
<i>Mab Saidi</i> occurs in the Kulhwch story (<i>Mabinogion</i>, p.
106), also Cas, son of Saidi (ib. 110); and in <i>Rhonabwy&rsquo;s
Dream</i> Kadyrieith, son of Saidi (ib. 160); but the latter vocable is
<i>Seidi</i> in Triad ii. 26 (ib. 303). It is to be borne in mind that
Ptolemy does not represent the Setantii as a people in his time: he
only mentions a harbour called after the Setantii. So it looks as if
they then belonged to the past&mdash;that in fact they were, as I
should put it, a Goidelic people who had been conquered and partly
expelled by Brythonic tribes, to wit, by the Brigantes, and also by the
Cornavii in case the Setantii had once extended southwards to the Dee.
This naturally leads one to think that some of them escaped to places
on the coast, such as Dyfed, and that some made for the opposite coast
of Ireland, and that, by the time when the C&uacute;chulainn stories
came to be edited as we have them, the people in question were known to
the redactors of those stories only by the Brythonic form of their
name, which underlies that of <i>Setanta Beg</i>, or the Little
Setantian. Those of them who found a home on the coast of Cardigan Bay
may have brought with them a version of the inundation story with
Seithennin, son of Seithyn, as the principal figure in it. So in due
time he had to be attached to some royal family, and in the <i>Iolo
MSS.</i>, pp. 141&ndash;2, he is made to descend from a certain Plaws
Hen, king of Dyfed, while the saints named as his descendants seem to
have belonged chiefly to Gwyne&#273; and Powys.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow"

Professor Meyer has given a number of extracts concerning her in his
notes to his edition of <i>The Vision of Mac Conglinne</i> (London,
1892), pp. 131&ndash;4, 208&ndash;10, and recently he has published
<i>The Song of the Old Woman of Beare</i> in the <i>Otia Merseiana</i>
(London, 1899), pp. 119&ndash;28, from the Trinity College codex, H. 3,
18, where we are told, among other things, that her name was Digdi, and
that she belonged to Corcaguiny. The name B&eacute;ara, or
B&eacute;rre, would seem to suggest identification with that of Bera,
daughter of Eibhear, king of Spain, and wife of Eoghan Taidhleach, in
the late story of <i>The Courtship of Mom&eacute;ra</i>, edited by
O&rsquo;Curry in his <i>Battle of Magh Leana</i> (Dublin, 1855); but
the other name Digdi would seem to stand in the way. However none of
the literature in point has yet been discovered in any really old
manuscript, and it may be that the place-name <i>Berre</i>, in
<i>Caillech B&eacute;rri</i>, has usurped the place of the personal
name <i>B&eacute;ra</i>, whose antiquity in some such a form as
<i>B&eacute;ra</i> or <i>M&eacute;ra</i> is proved by its honorific
form <i>Mo-mera</i>: see O&rsquo;Curry&rsquo;s volume, p. 166, and his

<p class="first">More than once in the last chapter was the subject of
submersions and cataclysms brought before the reader, and it may be
convenient to enumerate here the most remarkable cases, and to add one
or two to their number, as well as to dwell at somewhat greater length
on some instances which may be said to have found their way into Welsh
literature. He has already been told of the outburst of the Glasfryn
Lake (p. 367) and Ffynnon Gywer (p. 376), of &#7930;yn &#7930;ech Owen
(p. 379) and the Crymlyn (p. 191), also of the drowning of
Cantre&rsquo;r Gwaelod (p. 383); not to mention that one of my
informants had something to say (p. 219) of the submergence of Caer
Arianrhod, a rock now visible only at low water between Celynnog Fawr
and Dinas Din&#7931;e, on the coast of Arfon. But, to put it briefly,
it is an ancient belief in the Principality that its lakes generally
have swallowed up habitations of men, as in the case of &#7930;yn
Syfa&#273;on (p. 73) and the Pool of Corwrion (p. 57). To these I now
proceed to add other instances, to wit those of Bala Lake, Kenfig Pool,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb402" href="#v2pb402" name=
"v2pb402">402</a>]</span>&#7930;ynclys, and Helig ab Glannog&rsquo;s
territory including Traeth Lafan.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is best to begin with historical events, namely those
implied in the encroachment of the sea and the sand on the coast of
Glamorganshire, from the Mumbles, in Gower, to the mouth of the Ogmore,
below Bridgend. It is believed that formerly the shores of Swansea Bay
were from three to five miles further out than the present strand, and
the oyster dredgers point to that part of the bay which they call the
Green Grounds, while trawlers, hovering over these sunken meadows of
the Grove Island, declare that they can sometimes see the foundations
of the ancient homesteads overwhelmed by a terrific storm which raged
some three centuries ago. The old people sometimes talk of an extensive
forest called <i lang="cy">Coed Arian</i>, &lsquo;Silver Wood,&rsquo;
stretching from the foreshore of the Mumbles to Kenfig Burrows, and
there is a tradition of a long-lost bridle path used by many
generations of Mansels, Mowbrays, and Talbots, from Penrice Castle to
Margam Abbey. All this is said to be corroborated by the fishing up
every now and then in Swansea Bay of stags&rsquo; antlers, elks&rsquo;
horns, those of the wild ox, and wild boars&rsquo; tusks, together with
the remains of other ancient tenants of the submerged forest. Various
references in the registers of Swansea and Aberavon mark successive
stages in the advance of the desolation from the latter part of the
fifteenth century down. Among others a great sandstorm is mentioned,
which overwhelmed the borough of Cynffig or Kenfig, and encroached on
the coast generally: the series of catastrophes seems to have
culminated in an inundation caused by a terrible tidal wave in the
early part of the year 1607<a class="noteref" id="xd26e12484src" href=
"#xd26e12484" name="xd26e12484src">1</a>. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb403" href="#v2pb403" name="v2pb403">403</a>]</span></p>
<p>To return to Kenfig, what remains of that old town is near the sea,
and it is on all sides surrounded by hillocks of finely powdered sand
and flanked by ridges of the same fringing the coast. The ruins of
several old buildings half buried in the sand peep out of the ground,
and in the immediate neighbourhood is Kenfig Pool, which is said to
have a circumference of nearly two miles. When the pool formed itself I
have not been able to discover: from such accounts as have come in my
way I should gather that it is older than the growing spread of the
sand, but the island now to be seen in it is artificial and of modern
make<a class="noteref" id="xd26e12493src" href="#xd26e12493" name=
"xd26e12493src">2</a>. The story relating to the lake is given as
follows in the volume of the <i>Iolo Manuscripts</i>, p. 194, and the
original, from which I translate, is crisp, compressed, and, as I
fancy, in Iolo&rsquo;s own words:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A plebeian was in love with Earl Clare&rsquo;s daughter: she
would not have him as he was not wealthy. He took to the highway, and
watched the agent of the lord of the dominion coming towards the castle
from collecting his lord&rsquo;s money. He killed him, took the money,
and produced the coin, and the lady married him. A splendid banquet was
held: the best men of the country were invited, and they made as merry
as possible. On the second night the marriage was consummated, and when
happiest one heard a voice: all ear one listened and caught the words,
&ldquo;Vengeance comes, vengeance comes, vengeance comes,&rdquo; three
times. One asked, &ldquo;When?&rdquo; &ldquo;In the ninth generation
(<i lang="cy">&acirc;ch</i>),&rdquo; said the voice. &ldquo;No reason
for us to fear,&rdquo; said the married pair; &ldquo;we shall be under
the mould long before.&rdquo; They lived on, however, and a <i lang=
"cy">goresgynny&#273;</i>, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb404" href=
"#v2pb404" name="v2pb404">404</a>]</span>that is to say, a descendant
of the sixth direct generation, was born to them, also to the murdered
man a <i lang="cy">goresgynny&#273;</i>, who, seeing that the time
fixed was come, visited Kenfig. This was a discreet youth of gentle
manners, and he looked at the city and its splendour, and noted that
nobody owned a furrow or a chamber there except the offspring of the
murderer: he and his wife were still living. At cockcrow he heard a
cry, &ldquo;Vengeance is come, is come, is come.&rdquo; It is asked,
&ldquo;On whom?&rdquo; and answered, &ldquo;On him who murdered my
father of the ninth <i lang="cy">&acirc;ch</i>.&rdquo; He rises in
terror: he goes towards the city; but there is nothing to see save a
large lake with three chimney tops above the surface emitting smoke
that formed a stinking&#8202;&hellip;.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e12519src" href="#xd26e12519" name="xd26e12519src">3</a> On the
face of the waters the gloves of the murdered man float to the young
man&rsquo;s feet: he picks them up, and sees on them the murdered
man&rsquo;s name and arms; and he hears at dawn of day the sound of
praise to God rendered by myriads joining in heavenly music. And so the
story ends.&rsquo;</p>
<p>On this coast is another piece of water in point, namely Crymlyn, or
&lsquo;Crumlin Pool,&rsquo; now locally called the Bog. It appears also
to have been sometimes called Pw&#7931; Cynan, after the name of a son
of Rhys ab Tewdwr, who, in his flight after his father&rsquo;s defeat
on Hirwaen Wrgan, was drowned in its waters<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e12527src" href="#xd26e12527" name="xd26e12527src">4</a>. It lies
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb405" href="#v2pb405" name=
"v2pb405">405</a>]</span>on Lord Jersey&rsquo;s estate, at a distance
of about one mile east of the mouth of the Tawe, and about a quarter of
a mile from high-water mark, from which it is separated by a strip of
ground known in the neighbourhood as Crymlyn Burrows. The name Crymlyn
means Crooked Lake, which, I am told, describes the shape of this piece
of water. When the bog becomes a pool it encloses an island consisting
of a little rocky hillock showing no trace of piles, or walling, or any
other handiwork of man<a class="noteref" id="xd26e12557src" href=
"#xd26e12557" name="xd26e12557src">5</a>. The story about this pool
also is that it covers a town buried beneath its waters. Mr. Wirt
Sikes&rsquo; reference to it has already been mentioned, and I have it
on the evidence of a native of the immediate neighbourhood, that he has
often heard his father and grandfather talk about the submerged town.
Add to this that Cadrawd, to whom I have had already (pp. 23, 376) to
acknowledge my indebtedness, speaks in the columns of the <i>South
Wales Daily News</i> for February 15, 1899, of Crymlyn as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was said by the old people that on the site of this bog
once stood the old town of Swansea, and that in clear and calm weather
the chimneys and even the church steeple could be seen at the bottom of
the lake, and in the loneliness of the night the bells were often heard
ringing in the lake. It was also said that should any person happen to
stand with his face towards the lake when the wind is blowing across
the lake, and if any of the spray of that water should touch his
clothes, it would be only with the greatest difficulty he could save
himself from being attracted or sucked into the water. The lake was at
one time much larger than at present. The efforts made to drain it have
drawn a good deal of the water from it, but only to convert it
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb406" href="#v2pb406" name=
"v2pb406">406</a>]</span>into a bog, which no one can venture to cross
except in exceptionally dry seasons or hard frost.&rsquo;</p>
<p>On this I wish to remark in passing, that, while common sense would
lead one to suppose that the wind blowing across the water would help
the man facing it to get away whenever he chose, the reasoning here is
of another order, one characteristic in fact of the ways and means of
sympathetic magic. For specimens in point the reader may be
conveniently referred to page 360, where he may compare the words
quoted from Mr. Hartland, especially as to the use there mentioned of
stones or pellets thrown from one&rsquo;s hands. In the case of
Crymlyn, the wind blowing off the face of the water into the
onlooker&rsquo;s face and carrying with it some of the water in the
form of spray which wets his clothes, howsoever little, was evidently
regarded as establishing a link of connexion between him and the body
of the water&mdash;or shall I say rather, between him and the divinity
of the water?&mdash;and that this link was believed to be so strong
that it required the man&rsquo;s utmost effort to break it and escape
being drawn in and drowned like Cynan. The statement, supremely silly
as it reads, is no modern invention; for one finds that
Nennius&mdash;or somebody else&mdash;reasoned in precisely the same
way, except that for a single onlooker he substitutes a whole army of
men and horses, and that he points the antithesis by distinctly
stating, that if they kept their backs turned to the fascinating flood
they would be out of danger. The conditions which he had in view were,
doubtless, that the men should face the water and have their clothing
more or less wetted by the spray from it. The passage (&sect; 69) to
which I refer is in the <i>Mirabilia</i>, and Geoffrey of Monmouth is
found to repeat it in a somewhat better style of Latin (ix. 7): the
following is the Nennian version:&mdash; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p>&lsquo;There is another wonder, to wit Aber &#7930;yn &#7930;iwan.
The water from the mouth of that river flows into the Severn, and when
the Severn is in flood up to its banks, and when the sea is also in
flood at the mouth of the above-named river and is sucked in like a
whirlpool into the pool of the Aber, the sea does not go on rising: it
leaves a margin of beach by the side of the river, and all the time the
Severn is in flood up to its bank, that beach is not covered. And when
the sea and the Severn ebb, then &#7930;yn &#7930;iwan brings up all it
had swallowed from the sea, and that beach is covered while &#7930;yn
&#7930;iwan discharges its contents in one mountain-like wave and
vomits forth. Now if the army of the whole district in which this
wonder is, were to be present with the men facing the wave, the force
of it would, once their clothes are drenched by the spray, draw them
in, and their horses would likewise be drawn. But if the men should
have their backs turned towards the water, the wave would not harm
them<a class="noteref" id="xd26e12580src" href="#xd26e12580" name=

<p>One story about the formation of Bala Lake, or &#7930;yn
Tegid<a class="noteref" id="xd26e12586src" href="#xd26e12586" name=
"xd26e12586src">7</a> as it is called in Welsh, has been given at p.
376: here is another which I translate from a version in Hugh
Humphreys&rsquo; <i lang="cy">&#7930;yfr Gwybodaeth Gyffredinol</i>
(Carnarvon), second series, vol. i, no. 2, p. 1. I may premise that the
contributor, whose name is not given, betrays a sort of literary
ambition which has led him to relate the story in a confused fashion;
and among other things he uses the word <i lang="cy">edifeirwch</i>,
&lsquo;repentance,&rsquo; throughout, instead of <i lang="cy">dial</i>,
&lsquo;vengeance.&rsquo; With that correction it runs somewhat as
follows:&mdash;Tradition relates that Bala Lake is but the watery tomb
of the palaces of iniquity; and that some old boatmen can on quiet
moonlight nights in harvest see towers in ruins at the bottom of its
waters, and also hear at times a feeble voice saying, <i lang="cy">Dial
a &#273;aw, dial a &#273;aw</i>, &lsquo;Vengeance will come&rsquo;; and
another voice inquiring, <i lang="cy">Pa bryd y daw</i>, &lsquo;When
will it come?&rsquo; Then the first voice answers, <i lang="cy">Yn y
dryde&#273; genhedlaeth</i>, &lsquo;In the third generation.&rsquo;
Those voices were but a recollection over oblivion, for in one of those
palaces lived in days of yore an oppressive and cruel prince,
corresponding to the well-known description of one of whom it is said,
&lsquo;Whom he would he slew; and whom he would he kept alive.&rsquo;
The oppression and cruelty practised by him on the poor farmers were
notorious far and near. This prince, while enjoying the morning breezes
of summer in his garden, used frequently to hear a voice saying,
&lsquo;Vengeance will come.&rsquo; But he always laughed the threat
away with reckless contempt. One night a poor harper <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb409" href="#v2pb409" name=
"v2pb409">409</a>]</span>from the neighbouring hills was ordered to
come to the prince&rsquo;s palace. On his way the harper was told that
there was great rejoicing at the palace at the birth of the first child
of the prince&rsquo;s son. When he had reached the palace the harper
was astonished at the number of the guests, including among them noble
lords, princes, and princesses: never before had he seen such splendour
at any feast. When he had begun playing the gentlemen and ladies
dancing presented a superb appearance. So the mirth and wine abounded,
nor did he love playing for them any more than they loved dancing to
the music of his harp. But about midnight, when there was an interval
in the dancing, and the old harper had been left alone in a corner, he
suddenly heard a voice singing in a sort of a whisper in his ear,
&lsquo;Vengeance, vengeance!&rsquo; He turned at once, and saw a little
bird hovering above him and beckoning him, as it were, to follow him.
He followed the bird as fast as he could, but after getting outside the
palace he began to hesitate. But the bird continued to invite him on,
and to sing in a plaintive and mournful voice the word
&lsquo;Vengeance, vengeance!&rsquo; The old harper was afraid of
refusing to follow, and so they went on over bogs and through thickets,
whilst the bird was all the time hovering in front of him and leading
him along the easiest and safest paths. But if he stopped for a moment
the same mournful note of &lsquo;Vengeance, vengeance!&rsquo; would be
sung to him in a more and more plaintive and heartbreaking fashion.
They had by this time reached the top of the hill, a considerable
distance from the palace. As the old harper felt rather fatigued and
weary, he ventured once more to stop and rest, but he heard the
bird&rsquo;s warning voice no more. He listened, but he heard nothing
save the murmuring of the little burn hard by. He now began to think
how foolish he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb410" href="#v2pb410"
name="v2pb410">410</a>]</span>had been to allow himself to be led away
from the feast at the palace: he turned back in order to be there in
time for the next dance. As he wandered on the hill he lost his way,
and found himself forced to await the break of day. In the morning, as
he turned his eyes in the direction of the palace, he could see no
trace of it: the whole tract below was one calm, large lake, with his
harp floating on the face of the waters.</p>
<p>Next comes the story of &#7930;ynclys Pool in the neighbourhood of
Oswestry. That piece of water is said to be of extraordinary depth, and
its name means the &lsquo;swallowed court.&rsquo; The village of
&#7930;ynclys is called after it, and the legend concerning the pool is
preserved in verses printed among the compositions of the local poet,
John F. M. Dovaston, who published his works in 1825. The first stanza
runs thus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Clerk Willin he sat at king Alaric&rsquo;s board,</p>
<p class="line xd26e2450">And a cunning clerk was he;</p>
<p class="line">For he&rsquo;d lived in the land of Oxenford</p>
<p class="line xd26e2450">With the sons of Grammarie.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">How much exactly of the poem comes from
Dovaston&rsquo;s own muse, and how much comes from the legend, I cannot
tell. Take for instance the king&rsquo;s name, this I should say is not
derived from the story; but as to the name of the clerk, that possibly
is, for the poet bases it on Croes-Willin, the Welsh form of which has
been given me as Croes-Wylan, that is Wylan&rsquo;s Cross, the name of
the base of what is supposed to have been an old cross, a little way
out of Oswestry on the north side; and I have been told that there is a
farm in the same neighbourhood called Tre&rsquo; Wylan,
&lsquo;Wylan&rsquo;s Stead.&rsquo; To return to the legend,
Alaric&rsquo;s queen was endowed with youth and beauty, but the king
was not happy; and when he had lived with her nine years he told Clerk
Willin how he first met her when he was <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb411" href="#v2pb411" name="v2pb411">411</a>]</span>hunting
&lsquo;fair Blodwell&rsquo;s rocks among.&rsquo; He married her on the
condition that she should be allowed to leave him one night in every
seven, and this she did without his once knowing whither she went on
the night of her absence. Clerk Willin promised to restore peace to the
king if he would resign the queen to him, and a tithe annually of his
cattle and of the wine in his cellar to him and the monks of the White
Minster. The king consented, and the wily clerk hurried away with his
book late at night to the rocks by the Giant&rsquo;s Grave, where there
was an <i lang="cy">ogo&rsquo;</i> or cave which was supposed to lead
down to Faery. While the queen was inside the cave, he began his spells
and made it irrevocable that she should be his, and that his fare
should be what fed on the king&rsquo;s meadow and what flowed in his
cellar. When the clerk&rsquo;s potent spells forced the queen to meet
him to consummate his bargain with the king, what should he behold but
a grim ogress, who told him that their spells had clashed. She
explained to him how she had been the king&rsquo;s wife for thirty
years, and how the king began to be tired of her wrinkles and old age.
Then, on condition of returning to the Ogo to be an ogress one night in
seven, she was given youth and beauty again, with which she attracted
the king anew. In fact, she had promised him happiness</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Till within his hall the flag-reeds tall</p>
<p class="line xd26e2450">And the long green rushes grow.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The ogress continued in words which made the clerk see
how completely he had been caught in his own net:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Then take thy bride to thy cloistered bed,</p>
<p class="line xd26e2450">As by oath and spell decreed,</p>
<p class="line">And nought be thy fare but the pike and the dare,</p>
<p class="line xd26e2450">And the water in which they feed.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The clerk had succeeded in restoring peace at the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb412" href="#v2pb412" name=
"v2pb412">412</a>]</span>king&rsquo;s banqueting board, but it was the
peace of the dead;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">For down went the king, and his palace and all,</p>
<p class="line xd26e2450">And the waters now o&rsquo;er it flow,</p>
<p class="line">And already in his hall do the flag-reeds tall</p>
<p class="line xd26e2450">And the long green rushes grow.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">But the visitor will, Dovaston says, find
Willin&rsquo;s peace relieved by the stories which the villagers have
to tell of that wily clerk, of Croes-Willin, and of &lsquo;the cave
called the Grim Ogo&rsquo;; not to mention that when the lake is clear,
they will show you the towers of the palace below, the &#7930;ynclys,
which the Brython of ages gone by believed to be there.</p>
<p>We now come to a different story about this pool, namely, one which
has been preserved in Latin by the historian Humfrey Lhuyd, or Humphrey
&#7930;wyd, to the following effect:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;After the description of <i>Gwynedh</i>, let vs now come to
<i>Powys</i>, the seconde kyngedome of <i>VVales</i>, which in the time
of German Altisiodorensis [St. Germanus of Auxerre], which preached
sometime there, agaynst Pelagius Heresie: was of power, as is gathered
out of his life. The kynge wherof, as is there read, bycause he refused
to heare that good man: by the secret and terrible iudgement of God,
with his Palace, and all his householde: was swallowed vp into the
bowels of the Earth, in that place, whereas, not farre from Oswastry,
is now a standyng water, of an vnknowne depth, called <i>Lhunclys</i>,
that is to say: the deuouryng of the Palace. And there are many
Churches founde in the same Province, dedicated to the name of
German<a class="noteref" id="xd26e12706src" href="#xd26e12706" name=
"xd26e12706src">8</a>.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb413"
href="#v2pb413" name="v2pb413">413</a>]</span></p>
<p>I have not succeeded in finding the story in any of the lives of St.
Germanus, but Nennius, &sect; 32, mentions a certain Benli, whom he
describes as <i lang="la">rex iniquus atque tyrannus valde</i>, who,
after refusing to admit St. Germanus and his following into his city,
was destroyed with all his courtiers, not by water, however, but by
fire from heaven. But the name Benli, in modern Welsh spelling
Ben&#7931;i<a class="noteref" id="xd26e12753src" href="#xd26e12753"
name="xd26e12753src">9</a>, points to the Moel Famau range of
mountains, one of which is known as Moel Fen&#7931;i, between Ruthin
and Mold, rather than to any place near Oswestry. In any case there is
no reason to suppose that this story with its Christian and ethical
motive is anything like so old as the substratum of Dovaston&rsquo;s
verses.</p>
<p>The only version known to me in the Welsh language of the
&#7930;ynclys legend is to be found printed in the <i>Brython</i> for
1863, p. 338, and it may be summarized as follows:&mdash;The
&#7930;ynclys family were notorious for their riotous living, and at
their feasts a voice used to be heard proclaiming, &lsquo;Vengeance is
coming, coming,&rsquo; but nobody took it much to heart. However, one
day a reckless maid asked the voice, &lsquo;When?&rsquo; The prompt
reply was to the effect that it was in the sixth generation: the voice
was heard no more. So one night, when the sixth heir in descent from
the time of the warning last heard was giving a great drinking feast,
and music had been vigorously contributing to the entertainment of host
and guest, the harper went outside for a breath of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb414" href="#v2pb414" name=
"v2pb414">414</a>]</span>air; but when he turned to come back, lo and
behold! the whole court had disappeared. Its place was occupied by a
quiet piece of water, on whose waves he saw his harp floating, nothing
more.</p>
<p>Here must, lastly, be added one more legend of submergence, namely,
that supposed to have taken place some time or other on the north coast
of Carnarvonshire. In the <i>Brython</i> for 1863, pp. 393&ndash;4, we
have what purports to be a quotation from Owen Jones&rsquo; <i lang=
"cy">Aberconwy a&rsquo;i Chyffiniau</i>, &lsquo;Conway and its
Environs,&rsquo; a work which I have not been able to find. Here one
reads of a tract of country supposed to have once extended from the
Gogarth<a class="noteref" id="xd26e12790src" href="#xd26e12790" name=
"xd26e12790src">10</a>, &lsquo;the Great Orme,&rsquo; to Bangor, and
from &#7930;anfair Fechan to Ynys Seiriol, &lsquo;Priestholme or Puffin
Island,&rsquo; and of its belonging to a wicked prince named Helig ab
Glannawc or Glannog<a class="noteref" id="xd26e12837src" href=
"#xd26e12837" name="xd26e12837src">11</a>, from whom it was called
<i lang="cy">Tyno Helig</i>, &lsquo;Helig&rsquo;s Hollow.&rsquo;
Tradition, the writer says, fixes the spot where the court stood about
halfway between Penmaen Mawr and Pen y Gogarth, &lsquo;the Great
Orme&rsquo;s Head,&rsquo; over against Trwyn yr Wylfa; and the story
relates that here a calamity had been foretold four generations before
it came, namely as the vengeance of Heaven on Helig ab Glannog for his
nefarious impiety. As that ancient prince rode through his fertile
heritage one day at the approach of night, he heard the voice of an
invisible follower warning him that &lsquo;Vengeance is coming,
coming.&rsquo; The wicked old prince once asked excitedly,
&lsquo;When?&rsquo; The answer was, &lsquo;In the time of thy
grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and their children.&rsquo;
Peradventure <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb415" href="#v2pb415"
name="v2pb415">415</a>]</span>Helig calmed himself with the thought,
that, if such a thing came, it would not happen in his lifetime. But on
the occasion of a great feast held at the court, and when the family
down to the fifth generation were present taking part in the
festivities, one of the servants noticed, when visiting the mead cellar
to draw more drink, that water was forcing its way in. He had only time
to warn the harper of the danger he was in, when all the others, in the
midst of their intoxication, were overwhelmed by the flood.<a id=
"xd26e12855" name="xd26e12855"></a></p>
<p>These inundation legends have many points of similarity among
themselves: thus in those of &#7930;ynclys, Syfa&#273;on, &#7930;yn
Tegid, and Tyno Helig, though they have a ring of austerity about them,
the harper is a favoured man, who always escapes when the banqueters
are all involved in the catastrophe. The story, moreover, usually
treats the submerged habitations as having sunk intact, so that the
ancient spires and church towers may still at times be seen: nay the
chimes of their bells may be heard by those who have ears for such
music. In some cases there may have been, underlying the legend, a
trace of fact such as has been indicated to me by Mr. Owen M. Edwards,
of Lincoln College, in regard to Bala Lake. When the surface of that
water, he says, is covered with broken ice, and a south-westerly wind
is blowing, the mass of fragments is driven towards the north-eastern
end near the town of Bala; and he has observed that the friction
produces a somewhat metallic noise which a quick imagination may
convert into something like a distant ringing of bells. Perhaps the
most remarkable instance remains to be mentioned: I refer to
Cantre&rsquo;r Gwaelod, as the submerged country of Gwy&#273;no
Garanhir is termed, see p. 382 above. To one portion of his fabled
realm the nearest actual centres of population are Aberdovey and Borth
on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb416" href="#v2pb416" name=
"v2pb416">416</a>]</span>either side of the estuary of the Dovey. As
bursar of Jesus College I had business in 1892 in the Golden Valley of
Herefordshire, and I stayed a day or two at Dorstone enjoying the
hospitality of the rectory, and learning interesting facts from the
rector, Mr. Prosser Powell, and from Mrs. Powell in particular, as to
the folklore of the parish, which is still in several respects very
Welsh. Mrs. Powell, however, did not confine herself to Dorstone or the
Dore Valley, for she told me as follows:&mdash;&lsquo;I was at
Aberdovey in 1852, and I distinctly remember that my childish
imagination was much excited by the legend of the city beneath the sea,
and the bells which I was told might be heard at night. I used to lie
awake trying, but in vain, to catch the echoes of the chime. I was only
seven years old, and cannot remember who told me the story, though I
have never forgotten it.&rsquo; Mrs. Powell added that she has since
heard it said, that at a certain stage of the tide at the mouth of the
Dovey, the way in which the waves move the pebbles makes them produce a
sort of jingling noise which has been fancied to be the echo of distant
bells ringing.</p>
<p>These clues appeared too good to be dropped at once, and the result
of further inquiries led Mrs. Powell afterwards to refer me to <i>The
Monthly Packet</i> for the year 1859, where I found an article headed
&lsquo;Aberdovey Legends,&rsquo; and signed M. B., the initials, Mrs.
Powell thought, of Miss Bramston of Winchester. The writer gives a
sketch of the story of the country overflowed by the neighbouring
portion of Cardigan Bay, mentioning, p. 645, that once on a time there
were great cities on the banks of the Dovey and the Disynni.
&lsquo;Cities with marble wharfs,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;busy
factories, and churches whose towers resounded with beautiful peals and
chimes of bells.&rsquo; She goes on to say that &lsquo;Mausna
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb417" href="#v2pb417" name=
"v2pb417">417</a>]</span>is the name of the city on the Dovey; its
eastern suburb was at the sand-bank now called Borth, its western
stretched far out into the sea.&rsquo; What the name Mausna may be I
have no idea, unless it is the result of some confusion with that of
the great turbary behind Borth, namely Mochno, or <i lang="cy">Cors
Fochno</i>, &lsquo;Bog of Mochno.&rsquo; The name Borth stands for
<i lang="cy">Y Borth</i>, &lsquo;the Harbour,&rsquo; which, more
adequately described, was once <i>Porth Wy&#273;no</i>,
&lsquo;Gwy&#273;no&rsquo;s Harbour.&rsquo; The writer, however, goes on
with the story of the wicked prince, who left open the sluices of the
sea-wall protecting his country and its capital: we read on as
follows:&mdash;&lsquo;But though the sea will not give back that fair
city to light and air, it is keeping it as a trust but for a time, and
even now sometimes, though very rarely, eyes gazing down through the
green waters can see not only the fluted glistering sand dotted here
and there with shells and tufts of waving sea-weed, but the wide
streets and costly buildings of that now silent city. Yet not always
silent, for now and then will come chimes and peals of bells, sometimes
near, sometimes distant, sounding low and sweet like a call to prayer,
or as rejoicing for a victory. Even by day these tones arise, but more
often they are heard in the long twilight evenings, or by night.
English ears have sometimes heard these sounds even before they knew
the tale, and fancied that they must come from some church among the
hills, or on the other side of the water, but no such church is there
to give the call; the sound and its connexion is so pleasant, that one
does not care to break the spell by seeking for the origin of the
legend, as in the idler tales with which that neighbourhood
abounds.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The dream about &lsquo;the wide streets and costly buildings of that
now silent city&rsquo; seems to have its counterpart on <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb418" href="#v2pb418" name=
"v2pb418">418</a>]</span>the western coast of Erin&mdash;somewhere, let
us say, off the cliffs of Moher<a class="noteref" id="xd26e12881src"
href="#xd26e12881" name="xd26e12881src">12</a>, in County
Clare&mdash;witness Gerald Griffin&rsquo;s lines, to which a passing
allusion has already been made, p. 205:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">A story I heard on the cliffs of the West,</p>
<p class="line xd26e2450">That oft, through the breakers dividing,</p>
<p class="line">A city is seen on the ocean&rsquo;s wild breast,</p>
<p class="line xd26e2450">In turreted majesty riding.</p>
<p class="line">But brief is the glimpse of that phantom so bright:</p>
<p class="line xd26e2450">Soon close the white waters to screen it.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The allusion to the submarine chimes would make it
unpardonable to pass by unnoticed the well-known Welsh air called
<i lang="cy">Clychau Aberdyfi</i>, &lsquo;The Bells of
Aberdovey,&rsquo; which I have always suspected of taking its name from
fairy bells<a class="noteref" id="xd26e12908src" href="#xd26e12908"
name="xd26e12908src">13</a>. This popular tune is of unknown origin,
and the words to which it is usually sung make the bells say <i lang=
"cy">un, dau, tri, pedwar, pump, chwech</i>, &lsquo;one, two, three,
four, five, six&rsquo;; and I have heard a charming Welsh vocalist
putting on <i lang="cy">saith</i>, &lsquo;seven,&rsquo; in her
rendering of the song. This is not to be wondered at, as her instincts
must have rebelled against such a commonplace number as six in a song
redolent of old-world sentiment. But our fairy bells ought to have
stopped at five: this would seem to have been forgotten when the melody
and the present words were wedded together. At any rate our stories
seem to suggest that fairy counting did not go beyond the fingering of
one hand. The only Welsh fairy represented counting is made to do it
all by fives: she counts <i lang="cy">un, dau, tri, pedwar, pump; un,
dau, tri, pedwar, pump</i>, as hard as her tongue can go. For on the
number of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb419" href="#v2pb419" name=
"v2pb419">419</a>]</span>times she can repeat the five numerals at a
single breath depends the number of the live stock of each kind, which
are to form her dowry: see p. 8 above, and as to music in fairy tales,
see pp. 202, 206, 292.</p>
<p>Now that a number of our inundation stories have been passed in
review in this and the previous chapter, some room may be given to the
question of their original form. They separate themselves, as it will
have been seen, into at least two groups: (1) those in which the cause
of the catastrophe is ethical, the punishment of the wicked and
dissolute; and (2) those in which no very distinct suggestion of the
kind is made. It is needless to say that everything points to the
comparative lateness of the fully developed ethical motive; and we are
not forced to rest content with this theoretical distinction, for in
more than one of the instances we have the two kinds of story. In the
case of &#7930;yn Tegid, the less known and presumably the older story
connects the formation of the lake with the neglect to keep the stone
door of the well shut, while the more popular story makes the
catastrophe a punishment for wicked and riotous living: compare pp.
377, 408, above. So with the older story of Cantre&rsquo;r Gwaelod, on
which we found the later one of the tipsy Seithennin as it were
grafted, p. 395. The keeping of the well shut in the former case, as
also in that of Ffynnon Gywer, was a precaution, but the neglect of it
was not the cause of the ensuing misfortune. Even if we had stories
like the Irish ones, which make the sacred well burst forth in pursuit
of the intruder who has gazed into its depths, it would by no means be
of a piece with the punishment of riotous and lawless living. Our
comparison should rather be with the story of the Curse of Pantannas,
where a man incurred the wrath of the fairies by ploughing up ground
which they wished to retain as a green sward; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb420" href="#v2pb420" name=
"v2pb420">420</a>]</span>but the threatened vengeance for that act of
culture did not come to pass for a century, till the time of one, in
fact, who is not charged with having done anything to deserve it. The
ethics of that legend are, it is clear, not easy to discover, and in
our inundation stories one may trace stages of development from a
similarly low level. The case may be represented thus: a divinity is
offended by a man, and for some reason or other the former wreaks his
vengeance, not on the offender, but on his descendants. This minimum
granted, it is easy to see, that in time the popular conscience would
fail to rest satisfied with the cruel idea of a jealous divinity
visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children. One may
accordingly distinguish the following stages:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. The legend lays it down as a fact that the father was very
wicked.</p>
<p>2. It makes his descendants also wicked like him.</p>
<p>3. It represents the same punishment overtaking father and sons,
ancestor and descendants.</p>
<p>4. The simplest way to secure this kind of equal justice was, no
doubt, to let the offending ancestors live on to see their descendants
of the generation for whose time the vengeance had been fixed, and to
let them be swept away with them in one and the same cataclysm, as in
the Welsh versions of the Syfa&#273;on and Kenfig legends, possibly
also in those of &#7930;yn Tegid and Tyno Helig, which are not explicit
on this point.</p>
<p>Let us for a moment examine the indications of the time to which the
vengeance is put off. In the case of the landed families of ancient
Wales, every member of them had his position and liabilities settled by
his pedigree, which had to be exactly recorded down to the eighth
generation or eighth lifetime in Gwyne&#273;, and to the seventh in
Gwent and Dyfed. Those generations were reckoned the limits of
recognized family relationship <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb421"
href="#v2pb421" name="v2pb421">421</a>]</span>according to the Welsh
Laws, and to keep any practical reckoning of the kind, extending always
back some two centuries, must have employed a class of professional
men<a class="noteref" id="xd26e12943src" href="#xd26e12943" name=
"xd26e12943src">14</a>. In any case the ninth generation, called in
Welsh <i lang="cy">y nawfed &acirc;ch</i>, which is a term in use all
over the Principality at the present day, is treated as lying outside
all recognized kinship. Thus if <i>AB</i> wishes to say that he is no
relation to <i>CD</i>, he will say that he is not related <i lang=
"cy">o fewn y nawfed &acirc;ch</i>, &lsquo;within the ninth
degree,&rsquo; or <i lang="cy">hyd y nawfed &acirc;ch</i>, &lsquo;up to
the ninth degree,&rsquo; it being understood that in the ninth degree
and beyond it no relationship is reckoned. Folklore stories, however,
seem to suggest another interpretation of the word <i lang=
"cy">&acirc;ch</i>, and fewer generations in the direct line as
indicated in the following table. For the sake of simplicity the
founder of the family is here assumed to have at least two sons,
<i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, and each succeeding generation to consist of one
son only; and lastly the women are omitted altogether:&mdash;</p>

<p>In reckoning the relationships between the collateral members of the
family, one counts not generations or begettings, not removes or
degrees, but ancestry or the number of ancestors, so that the father or
founder of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb422" href="#v2pb422" name=
"v2pb422">422</a>]</span>the family only counts once. Thus his
descendants A<sup>d</sup> and B<sup>d</sup> in the sixth generation or
lifetime, are fourth cousins separated from one another by nine
ancestors: that is, they are related in the ninth <i lang=
"cy">&acirc;ch</i>. In other words, A<sup>d</sup> has five ancestors
and B<sup>d</sup> has also five, but as they have one ancestor in
common, the father of the family, they are not separated by 5 + 5
ancestors, but by 5 + 5 - 1, that is by 9. Similarly, one being always
subtracted, the third cousins A<sup>c</sup> and B<sup>c</sup> are
related in the seventh <i lang="cy">&acirc;ch</i>, and the second
cousin in the fifth <i lang="cy">&acirc;ch</i>: so with the others in
odd numbers downwards, and also with the relatives reckoned upwards to
the seventh or eighth generation, which would mean collaterals
separated by eleven or thirteen ancestors respectively. This reckoning,
which is purely conjectural, is based chiefly on the Kenfig story,
which foretold the vengeance to come in the ninth <i lang=
"cy">&acirc;ch</i> and otherwise in the time of the <i lang=
"cy">goresgynny&#273;</i>, that is to say in the sixth lifetime. This
works out all right if only by the ninth <i lang="cy">&acirc;ch</i> we
understand the generation or lifetime when the collaterals are
separated by nine ancestors, for that is no other than the sixth from
the founder of the family. The Welsh version of the &#7930;ynclys
legend fixes on the same generation, as it says <i lang="cy">yn oes
wyrion, gorwyrion, esgynny&#273; a goresgynny&#273;</i>, &lsquo;in the
lifetime of grandsons, great-grandsons, ascensors, and their
children,&rsquo; for these last&rsquo;s time is the sixth generation.
In the case of the Syfa&#273;on legend the time of the vengeance is the
ninth <i lang="cy">cenhedlaeth</i> or generation, which must be
regarded as probably a careless way of indicating the generation when
the collaterals are separated by nine ancestors, that is to say the
sixth from the father of the family. It can hardly have the other
meaning, as the sinning ancestors are represented as then still living.
The case of the Tyno Helig legend is different, as we have the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb423" href="#v2pb423" name=
"v2pb423">423</a>]</span>time announced to the offending ancestor
described as <i lang="cy">amser dy wyrion, dy orwyrion, a dy
esgyny&#273;ion</i>, &lsquo;the time of thy grandsons, thy
great-grandsons, and thy ascensors,&rsquo; which would be only the
fifth generation with collaterals separated only by seven ancestors,
and not nine. But the probability is that <i lang=
"cy">goresgyny&#273;ion</i> has been here accidentally omitted, and
that the generation indicated originally was the same as in the others.
This, however, will not explain the Bala legend, which fixes the time
for the third generation, namely, immediately after the birth of the
offending prince&rsquo;s first grandson. If, however, as I am inclined
to suppose, the sixth generation with collaterals severed by nine
ancestors was the normal term in these stories, it is easy to
understand that the story-teller might wish to substitute a generation
nearer to the original offender, especially if he was himself to be
regarded as surviving to share in the threatened punishment: his living
to see the birth of his first grandson postulated no extraordinary
longevity.</p>
<p>The question why fairy vengeance is so often represented deferred
for a long time can no longer be put off. Here three or four answers
suggest themselves:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. The story of the Curse of Pantannas relates how the offender was
not the person punished, but one of his descendants a hundred or more
years after his time, while the offender is represented escaping the
fairies&rsquo; vengeance because he entreated them very hard to let him
go unpunished. All this seems to me but a sort of protest against the
inexorable character of the little people, a protest, moreover, which
was probably invented comparatively late.</p>
<p>2. The next answer is the very antithesis of the Pantannas one; for
it is, that the fairies delay in order to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb424" href="#v2pb424" name="v2pb424">424</a>]</span>involve all the
more men and women in the vengeance wreaked by them: I confess that I
see no reason to entertain so sinister an idea.</p>
<p>3. A better answer, perhaps, is that the fairies were not always in
a position to harm him who offended them. This may well have been the
belief as regards any one who had at his command the dreaded potency of
magic. Take for instance the Irish story of a king of Erin called
Eochaid Airem, who, with the aid of his magician or druid Dal&aacute;n,
defied the fairies, and dug into the heart of their underground
station, until, in fact, he got possession of his queen, who had been
carried thither by a fairy chief named Mider. Eochaid, assisted by his
druid and the powerful Ogams which the latter wrote on rods of yew, was
too formidable for the fairies, and their wrath was not executed till
the time of Eochaid&rsquo;s unoffending grandson, Conaire M&oacute;r,
who fell a victim to it, as related in the epic story of <i lang=
"cy">Bruden D&aacute;derga</i>, so called from the palace where Conaire
was slain<a class="noteref" id="xd26e13176src" href="#xd26e13176" name=
"xd26e13176src">15</a>.</p>
<p>4. Lastly, it may be said that the fairies being supposed deathless,
there would be no reason why they should hurry; and even in case the
delay meant a century or two, that makes no perceptible approach to the
extravagant scale of time common enough in our fairy tales, when, for
instance, they make a man who has whiled ages away in fairyland, deem
it only so many minutes<a class="noteref" id="xd26e13189src" href=
"#xd26e13189" name="xd26e13189src">16</a>. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb425" href="#v2pb425" name=
"v2pb425">425</a>]</span></p>
<p>Whatever the causes may have been which gave our stories their form
in regard of the delay in the fairy revenge, it is clear that Welsh
folklore could not allow this delay to extend beyond the sixth
generation with its cousinship of nine ancestries, if, as I gather, it
counted kinship no further. Had one projected it on the seventh or the
eighth generation, both of which are contemplated in the Laws, it would
not be folklore. It would more likely be the lore of the landed gentry
and of the powerful families whose pedigrees and ramifications of
kinship were minutely known to the professional men on whom it was
incumbent to keep themselves, and those on whom they depended, well
informed in such matters.</p>
<p>It remains for me to consider the non-ethical motive of the other
stories, such as those which ascribe negligence and the consequent
inundation to the woman who has the charge of the door or lid of the
threatening well. Her negligence is not the cause of the catastrophe,
but it leaves the way open for it. What then can have been regarded the
cause? One may gather something to the point from the Irish story where
the divinity of the well is offended because a woman has gazed into its
depths, and here probably, as already suggested (p. 392), we come
across an ancient tabu directed against women, which may have applied
only to certain wells of peculiarly sacred character. It serves,
however, to suggest that the divinities of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb426" href="#v2pb426" name=
"v2pb426">426</a>]</span>water-world were not disinclined to seize
every opportunity of extending their domain on the earth&rsquo;s
surface; and I am persuaded that this was once a universal creed of
some race or other in possession of these islands. Besides the Irish
legends already mentioned (pp. 382, 384) of the formation of Lough
Neagh, Lough Ree, and others, witness the legendary annals of early
Ireland, which, by the side of battles, the clearing of forests, and
the construction of causeways, mention the bursting forth of lakes and
rivers; that is to say, the formation or the coming into existence, or
else the serious expansion, of certain of the actual waters of the
country. For the present purpose the details given by <i>The Four
Masters</i> are sufficient, and I have hurriedly counted their
instances as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>This makes an aggregate of thirty-five lakes and forty-six rivers,
that is to say a total of eighty-one eruptions. But I ought, perhaps,
to explain that under the head of lakes I have included not only
separate pieces of water, but also six inlets of the sea, such as
Strangford Lough and the like. Still more to the point is it
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb427" href="#v2pb427" name=
"v2pb427">427</a>]</span>to mention that of the lakes two are said to
have burst forth at the digging of graves. Thus, <span class=
"sc"><abbr title="Anno Mundi">A.M.</abbr></span> 2535, <i>The Four
Masters</i> have the following: &lsquo;Laighlinne, son of Parthalon,
died in this year. When his grave was dug, Loch Laighlinne sprang forth
in Ui Mac Uais, and from him it is named<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e13621src" href="#xd26e13621" name="xd26e13621src">17</a>.&rsquo;
O&rsquo;Donovan, the editor and translator of <i>The Four Masters</i>,
supposes it to be somewhere to the south-west of Tara, in Meath.
Similarly, <span class="sc"><abbr title="Anno Mundi">A.M.</abbr></span>
4694, they say of a certain Melghe Molbthach, &lsquo;When his grave was
digging, Loch Melghe burst forth over the land in Cairbre, so that it
was named from him.&rsquo; This is said to be now called Lough Melvin,
on the confines of the counties of Donegal, Leitrim, and Fermanagh.
These two instances are mentioned by <i>The Four Masters</i>; and here
is one given by Stokes in the Rennes <i lang=
"cy">Dinds&#775;enchas</i>: see the <i lang="fr">Revue Celtique</i>,
xv. 428&ndash;9. It has to do with <i>Loch Garman</i>, as Wexford
Harbour was called in Irish, and it runs thus: &lsquo;<i>Loch
Garman</i>, whence is it? Easy to say. Garman Glas, son of Dega, was
buried there, and when his grave was dug then the lake burst throughout
the land. Whence <i>Loch Garman</i>.&rsquo; It matters not here that
there are alternative accounts of the name.</p>
<p>The meaning of all this seems to be that cutting the green sward or
disturbing the earth beneath was believed in certain cases to give
offence to some underground divinity or other connected with the world
of waters. That divinity avenged the annoyance or offence given him by
causing water to burst forth and form a lake forthwith. The nearness of
such divinities to the surface seems not a little remarkable,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb428" href="#v2pb428" name=
"v2pb428">428</a>]</span>and it is shown not only in the folklore which
has been preserved for us by <i>The Four Masters</i>, but also by the
usual kind of story about a neglected well door. These remarks suggest
the question whether it was not one of the notions which determined
surface burials, that is, burials in which no cutting of the ground
took place, the cists or chambers and the bodies placed in them being
covered over by the heaping on of earth or stones brought from a more
or less convenient distance. It might perhaps be said that all this
only implied individuals of a character to desecrate the ground and
call forth the displeasure of the divinities concerned; and for that
suggestion folklore parallels, it is true, could be adduced. But it is
hardly adequate: the facts seem to indicate a more general objection on
the part of the powers in point; and they remind one rather of the
clause said to be inserted in mining leases in China with the object,
if one may trust the newspapers, of preventing shafts from being sunk
below a certain depth, for fear of offending the susceptibilities of
the demons or dragons ruling underground.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note the fact, that Celtic folklore connects
the underground divinities intimately with water; for one may briefly
say that they have access wherever water can take them. With this
qualification the belief may be said to have lingered lately in Wales,
for instance, in connexion with &#7930;yn Barfog, near Aberdovey.
&lsquo;It is believed to be very perilous,&rsquo; Mr. Pughe says, p.
142 above, &lsquo;to let the waters out of the lake&rsquo;; and not
long before he wrote, in 1853, an aged inhabitant of the district
informed him &lsquo;that she recollected this being done during a
period of long drought, in order to procure motive power for &#7930;yn
Pair Mill, and that long-continued heavy rains followed.&rsquo; Then we
have the story related to Mr. Reynolds as to &#7930;yn y <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb429" href="#v2pb429" name=
"v2pb429">429</a>]</span>Fan Fach, how there emerged from the water a
huge hairy fellow of hideous aspect, who stormed at the disturbers of
his peace, and uttered the threat that unless they left him alone in
his own place he would drown a whole town. Thus the power of the water
spirit is represented as equal to producing excessive wet weather and
destructive floods. He is in all probability not to be dissociated from
the afanc in the Conwy story which has already been given (pp.
130&ndash;3). Now the local belief is that the reason why the afanc had
to be dragged out of the river was that he caused floods in the river
and made it impossible for people to cross on their way to market at
&#7930;anrwst. Some such a local legend has been generalized into a
sort of universal flood story in the late Triad, iii. 97, as
follows:&mdash;&lsquo;Three masterpieces of the Isle of Prydain: the
Ship of Nefy&#273; Naf Neifion, that carried in her male and female of
every kind when the Lake of &#7930;&iuml;on burst; and Hu the
Mighty&rsquo;s <i lang="cy">Ychen Bannog</i> dragging the afanc of the
lake to land, so that the lake burst no more; and the Stones of
Gwy&#273;on Ganhebon, on which one read all the arts and sciences of
the world.&rsquo; A story similar to the Conwy one, but no longer to be
got so complete, as far as I know, seems to have been current in
various parts of the Principality, especially around &#7930;yn
Syfa&#273;on and on the banks of the Anglesey pool called <i lang=
"cy">&#7930;yn yr Wyth Eidion</i>, &lsquo;the Pool of the Eight
Oxen,&rsquo; for so many is Hu represented here as requiring in dealing
with the Anglesey afanc. According to Mr. Pughe of Aberdovey, the same
feat was performed at &#7930;yn Barfog, not, however, by Hu and his
oxen, but by Arthur and his horse. To be more exact the task may be
here considered as done by Arthur superseding Hu: see p. 142 above.
That, however, is of no consequence here, and I return to the afanc:
the Fan Fach legend told to Mr. Reynolds <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb430" href="#v2pb430" name="v2pb430">430</a>]</span>makes the lake
ruler huge and hairy, hideous and rough-spoken, but he expresses
himself in human speech, in fact in two lines of doggerel: see p. 19
above. On the other hand, the &#7930;yn Cwm &#7930;wch story, which
puts the same doggerel, p. 21, into the mouth of the threatening figure
in red who sits in a chair on the face of that lake, suggests nothing
abnormal about his personal appearance. Then as to the Conwy afanc, he
is very heavy, it is true, but he also speaks the language of the
country. He is lured, be it noticed, out of his home in the lake by the
attractions of a young woman, who lets him rest his head in her lap and
fall asleep. When he wakes to find himself in chains he takes a cruel
revenge on her. But with infinite toil and labour he is dragged beyond
the Conwy watershed into one of the highest tarns on Snowdon; for there
is here no question of killing him, but only of removing him where he
cannot harm the people of the Conwy Valley. It is true that the story
of Peredur represents that knight cutting an afanc&rsquo;s head off,
but so much the worse for the compiler of that romance, as we have
doubtless in the afanc some kind of a deathless being. However, the
description which the Peredur story gives<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e13679src" href="#xd26e13679" name="xd26e13679src">18</a> of him
is interesting: he lives in a cave at the door of which is a stone
pillar: he sees everybody that comes without anybody seeing him; and
from behind the pillar he kills all comers with a poisoned spear.</p>
<p>Hitherto we have the afanc described mostly from a hostile point of
view: let us change our position, which some of the stories already
given enable us to do. Take for instance the first of the whole series,
where it describes, p. 7, the Fan Fach youth&rsquo;s despair when the
lake damsel, whose love he had gained, suddenly dived to fetch her
father and her sister. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb431" href=
"#v2pb431" name="v2pb431">431</a>]</span>There emerged, it says, out of
the lake two most beautiful ladies, accompanied by a hoary-headed man
of noble mien and extraordinary stature, but having otherwise all the
force and strength of youth. This hoary-headed man of noble mien owned
herds of cattle and flocks of sheep, a number of which were allowed to
come out of the lake to form his daughter&rsquo;s dowry, as the
narrative goes on to show. In the story of &#7930;yn Du&rsquo;r
Ar&#273;u, p. 32, he has a consort who appears with him to join in
giving the parental sanction to the marriage which their daughter was
about to make with the Snowdon shepherd. In neither of these stories
has this extraordinary figure any name given him, and it appears
<i lang="la">prima facie</i> probable that the term afanc is rather one
of abuse in harmony with the unlovely description of him supplied by
the other stories. But neither in them does the term <i lang="cy">yr
afanc</i> suit the monster meant, for there can be no doubt that in the
word afanc we have the etymological equivalent of the Irish word
<i lang="ga">abacc</i>, &lsquo;a dwarf&rsquo;; and till further light
is shed on these words one may assume that at one time afanc also meant
a dwarf or pigmy in Welsh. In modern Welsh it has been regarded as
meaning a beaver, but as that was too small an animal to suit the
popular stories, the word has been also gravely treated as meaning a
crocodile<a class="noteref" id="xd26e13698src" href="#xd26e13698" name=
"xd26e13698src">19</a>: this is in the teeth of the unanimous treatment
of him as anthropomorphic in the legends in point. If one is to abide
by the meaning dwarf or pigmy, one is bound to regard afanc as one of
the terms originally applied to the fairies in their more unlovely
aspects: compare the use of <i lang="cy">crimbil</i>, p. 263. Here may
also be mentioned <i lang="cy">pegor</i>, &lsquo;a dwarf <span class=

<p class="first">I should rather suppose, then, that the pigmies in the
water-world were believed to consist of many grades or classes, and to
be innumerable like the Luchorp&aacute;in of Irish legend, which were
likewise regarded as diminutive. With the Luchorp&aacute;in were also
associated<a class="noteref" id="xd26e13807src" href="#xd26e13807"
name="xd26e13807src">20</a> <i lang="ga">Fomori</i> or <i lang=
"ga">Fomoraig</i> (modern Irish spelling <i lang="ga">Fomhoraigh</i>),
and <i lang="ga">Goborchinn</i>, &lsquo;Horse-heads.&rsquo; The
etymology of the word <i>Fomori</i> has been indicated at p. 286 above,
but Irish legendary history has long associated it with <i>muir</i>,
&lsquo;sea,&rsquo; genitive <i>mara</i>, Welsh <i lang="cy">mor</i>,
and it has gone so far as to see in them, as there suggested, not
submarine but transmarine enemies and invaders of Ireland. So the
singular <i lang="ga">fomor</i>, now written <i lang="ga">fomhor</i>,
is treated in O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s <i>Irish Dictionary</i> as meaning
&lsquo;a pirate, a sea robber, a giant,&rsquo; while in Highland
Gaelic, where it is written <i>fomhair</i> or <i>famhair</i>, it is
regularly used as the word for giant. The Manx Gaelic corresponding to
Irish <i lang="ga">fomor</i> and its derivative <i lang=
"ga">fomorach</i>, is <i lang="ga">foawr</i>, &lsquo;a giant,&rsquo;
and <i lang="ga">foawragh</i>, &lsquo;gigantic,&rsquo; but also
&lsquo;a pirate.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb433" href=
"#v2pb433" name="v2pb433">433</a>]</span>I remember hearing, however,
years ago, a mention made of the <i lang="ga">Fomhoraigh</i>, which,
without conveying any definite allusion to their stature, associated
them with subterranean places:&mdash;An undergraduate from the
neighbourhood of Killorglin, in Kerry, happened to relate in my
hearing, how, when he was exploring some underground <i lang=
"ga">r&aacute;ths</i> near his home, he was warned by his
father&rsquo;s workmen to beware of the <i lang="ga">Fomhoraigh</i>.
But on the borders of the counties of Mayo and Sligo I have found the
word used as in the Scottish Highlands, namely, in the sense of giants,
while Dr. Douglas Hyde and others inform me that the Giant&rsquo;s
Causeway is called in Irish <i lang="ga">Cloch&aacute;n na
bh-Fomhorach</i>.</p>
<p>The Goborchinns or Horse-heads have also an interest, not only in
connexion with the Fomori, as when we read of a king of the latter
called Eocha Eachcheann<a class="noteref" id="xd26e13886src" href=
"#xd26e13886" name="xd26e13886src">21</a>, or Eochy Horse-head, but
also as a link between the Welsh afanc and the Highland water-horse, of
whom Campbell has a good deal to say in his <i>Popular Tales of the
West Highlands</i>. See more especially iv. 337, where he remarks among
other things, that &lsquo;the water-horse assumes many shapes; he often
appears as a man,&rsquo; he adds, &lsquo;and sometimes as a large
bird.&rsquo; A page or two earlier he gives a story which illustrates
the statement, at the same time that it vividly reminds one of that
part of the Conwy legend which (p. 130) represents the afanc resting
his head on the lap of the damsel forming one of the <i lang=
"la">dramatis person&aelig;</i>. Here follows Campbell&rsquo;s own
story, omitting all about a marvellous bull, however, that was in the
end to checkmate the water-horse:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A long time after these things a servant girl went with the
farmer&rsquo;s herd of cattle to graze them at the side of a loch, and
she sat herself down near the bank. There, in a little while, what
should she see walking <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb434" href=
"#v2pb434" name="v2pb434">434</a>]</span>towards her but a man, who
asked her to <i>fasg</i> his hair [Welsh <i lang="cy">&#7931;eua</i>].
She said she was willing enough to do him that service, and so he laid
his head on her knee, and she began to array his locks, as Neapolitan
damsels also do by their swains. But soon she got a great fright, for
growing amongst the man&rsquo;s hair, she found a great quantity of
<i lang="cy">liobhagach an locha</i>, a certain slimy green
weed<a class="noteref" id="xd26e13915src" href="#xd26e13915" name=
"xd26e13915src">22</a> that abounds in such lochs, fresh, salt, and
brackish. The girl knew that if she screamed there was an end of her,
so she kept her terror to herself, and worked away till the man fell
asleep as he was with his head on her knee. Then she untied her apron
strings, and slid the apron quietly on to the ground with its burden
upon it, and then she took her feet home as fast as it was in her
heart<a class="noteref" id="xd26e13919src" href="#xd26e13919" name=
"xd26e13919src">23</a>. Now when she was getting near the houses, she
gave a glance behind her, and there she saw her <i lang="cy">caraid</i>
(friend) coming after her in the likeness of a horse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The equine form belongs also more or less constantly to the kelpie
of the Lowlands of Scotland and of the Isle of Man, where we have him
in the glashtyn, whose amorous propensities are represented as more
repulsive than what appears in Welsh or Irish legend: see p. 289 above,
and the <i lang="cy">Lioar Manninagh</i> for 1897, p. 139. Perhaps in
Man and the Highlands the horsy nature of this being has been
reinforced by the influence of the Norse <i>Nykr</i>, a Northern
Proteus or old <i>Nick</i>, who takes many forms, but with a decided
preference for that of &lsquo;a gray water-horse&rsquo;: see
Vigfusson&rsquo;s <i>Icelandic-English Dictionary</i>. But the idea of
associating the equine form with the water divinity is by no means
confined to the Irish and the Northern nations: witness the Greek
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb435" href="#v2pb435" name=
"v2pb435">435</a>]</span>legend of the horse being of Poseidon&rsquo;s
own creation, and the beast whose form he sometimes assumed.</p>
<p>It is in this sort of a notion of a water-horse one is probably to
look for the key to the riddle of such conceptions as that of March ab
Meirchion, the king with horse&rsquo;s ears, and the corresponding
Irish figure of Labraid Lorc<a class="noteref" id="xd26e13943src" href=
"#xd26e13943" name="xd26e13943src">24</a>. In both of these the brute
peculiarities are reduced almost to a minimum: both are human in form
save their ears alone. The name <i>Labraid Lorc</i> is distinct enough
from the Welsh <i>March</i>, but under this latter name one detects
traces of him with the horse&rsquo;s ears in Wales, Cornwall, and
Brittany<a class="noteref" id="xd26e13974src" href="#xd26e13974" name=
"xd26e13974src">25</a>. We have also probably the same name in the
<i>Morc</i> of Irish legend: at any rate <i>Morc</i>, <i>Marc</i>, or
<i>Margg</i>, seems to be the same name as the Welsh <i>March</i>,
which is no other word than <i>march</i>, &lsquo;a steed or
charger.&rsquo; Now the Irish Morc is not stated to have had
horse&rsquo;s ears, but he and another called Conaing are represented
in the legendary history of early Erin as the naval leaders of the
Fomori, a sort of position which would seem to fit the Brythonic March
also were he to be treated in earnest as an historical character. But
short of that another treatment may be suspected of having been
actually dealt out to him, namely, that of resolving the water-horse
into a horse and his master. Of this we seem to have two instances in
the course of the story of the formation of Lough Neagh in the <i>Book
of the Dun Cow</i>, fo. 39&ndash;41:&mdash;</p>
<p>There was once a good king named Maired reigning over Munster, and
he had two sons, Eochaid and Rib. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb436" href="#v2pb436" name="v2pb436">436</a>]</span>He married a
wife named Ebliu (genitive <i>Eblinde</i>), who fell in love with her
stepson, Eochaid. The two brothers make up their minds to leave their
father and to take Ebliu with them, together with all that was theirs,
including in all a thousand men. They proceed northwards, but their
druids persuade them that they cannot settle down in the same district,
so Rib goes westwards to a plain known as <i lang="cy">T&iacute;r
Cluchi Midir acus Maic &Oacute;ic</i>, &lsquo;the Play-ground of Mider
and the Mac &Oacute;c,&rsquo; so called after the two great fairy
chiefs of Ireland. Mider visits Rib&rsquo;s camp and kills their
horses, then he gives them a big horse of his own ready harnessed with
a pack-saddle. They had to put all their baggage on the big
horse&rsquo;s back and go away, but after a while the nag lay down and
a well of water formed there, which eventually burst forth, drowning
them all: this is Loch Ri, &lsquo;Rib&rsquo;s Loch, or Lough
Ree,&rsquo; on the Shannon. Eochaid, the other brother, went with his
party to the banks of the Boyne near the Brug, where the fairy chief
Mac &Oacute;c or Mac ind &Oacute;c had his residence: he destroyed
Eochaid&rsquo;s horses the first night, and the next day he threatened
to destroy the men themselves unless they went away. Thereupon Eochaid
said that they could not travel without horses, so the Mac &Oacute;c
gave them a big horse, on whose back they placed all they had. The Mac
&Oacute;c warned them not to unload the nag on the way, and not to let
him halt lest he should be their death. However, when they had reached
the middle of Ulster, they thoughtlessly took all their property off
the horse&rsquo;s back, and nobody bethought him of turning the
animal&rsquo;s head back in the direction from which they had come: so
he also made a well<a class="noteref" id="xd26e14015src" href=

the well, which he set a woman to guard. In the sequel she neglected
it, and the well burst forth and formed Lough Neagh, as already
mentioned, p. 382 above. What became of the big horses in these stories
one is not told, but most likely they were originally represented as
vanishing in a spring of water where each of them stood. Compare the
account of Undine at her unfaithful husband&rsquo;s funeral. In the
procession she mysteriously appeared as a snow-white figure deeply
veiled, but when one rose from kneeling at the grave, where she had
knelt nought was to be seen save a little silver spring of limpid water
bubbling out of the turf and trickling on to surround the new
grave:&mdash;<i lang="de">Da man sich aber wieder erhob, war die weisse

<p>The late and grotesque story of the Gilla Decair may be mentioned
next: he was one of the Fomorach, and had a wonderful kind of horse on
whose back most of Finn&rsquo;s chief warriors were induced to mount.
Then the Gilla Decair and his horse hurried towards Corkaguiny, in
Kerry, and took to the sea, for he and his horse travelled equally well
on sea and land. Thus Finn&rsquo;s men, unable to dismount, were
carried prisoners to an island not named, on which Dermot in quest of
them afterwards landed, and from which, after great perils, he made his
way to T&iacute;r fo Thuinn, &lsquo;Terra sub Unda,&rsquo; and brought
his friends back to Erin<a class="noteref" id="xd26e14044src" href=

Gilla Decair was fifteen, fourteen on the back of his horse and one
clutching to the animal&rsquo;s tail, and the Welsh Triads, i. 93 = ii.
11, seem to re-echo some similar story, but they give the number of
persons not as fifteen but just one half, and describe the horse as Du
(y) Moroe&#273;, &lsquo;the Black of (the) Seas,&rsquo; steed of Elidyr
Mwynfawr, that carried seven human beings and a half from Pen
&#7930;ech Elidyr in the North to Pen &#7930;ech Elidyr in M&ocirc;n,
&lsquo;Anglesey.&rsquo; It is explained that Du carried seven on his
back, and that one who swam with his hands on that horse&rsquo;s
crupper was reckoned the half man in this case. Du Moroe&#273; is in
the story of Kulhwch and Olwen called Du March Moro, &lsquo;Black the
Steed of Moro,&rsquo; the horse ridden in the hunt of Twrch Trwyth by
Gwyn ab Nu&#273;, king of the other world; and he appears as a knight
with his name unmistakably rendered into Brun de Morois in the romance
of Durmart le Galois, who carries away Arthur&rsquo;s queen on his
horse to his castle in Morois<a class="noteref" id="xd26e14052src"
href="#xd26e14052" name="xd26e14052src">28</a>. Lastly, here also might
be mentioned the incident in the story of Peredur or Perceval, which
relates how to that knight, when he was in the middle of a forest much
distressed for the want of a horse, a lady brought a fine steed as
black as a blackberry. He mounted and he found his beast marvellously
swift, but on his making straight for a vast river the knight made the
sign of the cross, whereupon he was left on the ground, and his horse
plunged into the water, which his touch seemed to set ablaze. The horse
is interpreted to have been the devil<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e14061src" href="#xd26e14061" name="xd26e14061src">29</a>, and
this is a fair specimen of the way in which Celtic paganism is treated
by the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb439" href="#v2pb439" name=

assume an edifying attitude.</p>
<p>If one is right in setting M&ocirc;n, &lsquo;Anglesey,&rsquo; over
against the anonymous isle to which the Gilla Decair hurries
Finn&rsquo;s men away, Anglesey would have to be treated as having once
been considered one of the Islands of the Dead and the home of
Other-world inhabitants. We have a trace of this in a couplet in a poem
by the medieval poet, Dafy&#273; ab Gwilym, who makes Blodeuwe&#273;
the Owl give a bit of her history as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>On the great place given to islands in Celtic legend and myth it is
needless here to expatiate: witness <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p>Let us return to the more anthropomorphic figure of the afanc, and
take as his more favoured representative the virile personage described
emerging from the Fan Fach Lake to give his sanction to the marriage of
his daughter with the My&#273;fai shepherd. It is probable that a
divinity of the same order belonged to every other lake of any
considerable dimensions in the country. But it will be remembered that
in the case of the story of &#7930;yn Du&rsquo;r Ar&#273;u two parents
appeared with the lake maiden&mdash;her father and her mother&mdash;and
we may suppose that they were divinities of the water-world. The same
thing also may be inferred from the late Triad, iii. 13, which speaks
of the bursting of the lake of &#7930;&iuml;on, causing all the lands
to be inundated so that all the human race was drowned except Dwyfan
and Dwyfach, who escaped in a mastless ship: it was from them that the
island of Prydain was repeopled. A similar Triad, iii. 97, but
evidently of a different origin, has already been mentioned as speaking
of the Ship of Nefy&#273; Naf Neifion, that carried in it a male and
female of every kind when the lake of &#7930;&iuml;on burst. This later
Triad evidently supplies what had been forgotten in the previous one,
namely, a pair of each kind of animal life, and not of mankind alone.
But from the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb441" href="#v2pb441"
name="v2pb441">441</a>]</span>names Dwyfan and Dwyfach I infer that the
writer of Triad iii. 13 has developed his universal deluge on the basis
of the scriptural account of it, for those names belonged in all
probability to wells and rivers: in other terms, they were the names of
water divinities. At any rate there seems to be some evidence that two
springs, whose waters flow into Bala Lake, were at one time called
Dwyfan and Dwyfach, these names being borne both by the springs
themselves and the rivers flowing from them. The Dwyfan and the Dwyfach
were regarded as uniting in the lake, while the water on its issuing
from the lake is called Dyfrdwy. Now <i lang="cy">Dyfrdwy</i> stands
for an older <i lang="cy">Dyfr-dwyf</i>, which in Old Welsh was
<i lang="cy">Dubr duiu</i>, &lsquo;the water of the divinity.&rsquo;
One of the names of that divinity was <i>Donwy</i>, standing for an
early form <i>Danuvios</i> or <i>Danuvia</i>, according as it was
masculine or feminine. In either case it was practically the same name
as that of the <i>Danube</i> or <i>Danuvios</i>, derived from a word
which is represented in Irish by the adjective <i>d&aacute;na</i>,
&lsquo;<span lang="la">audax, fortis, intrepidus</span>.&rsquo; The Dee
has in Welsh poetry still another name, Aerfen, which seems to mean a
martial goddess or the spirit of the battlefield, which is corroborated
and explained by Giraldus<a class="noteref" id="xd26e14220src" href=
"#xd26e14220" name="xd26e14220src">33</a>, who represents the river as
the accredited arbiter of the fortunes of the wars in its country
between the Welsh and the English. The name Dyfrdonwy occurs in a poem
by &#7930;ywarch Brydy&#273; y Moch, a poet who flourished towards the
end of the twelfth century, as follows<a class="noteref" id=

<p>The prince praised was &#7930;ywelyn ab Iorwerth, whom the poet
seems to identify here with the Dee, and it looks as if the water of
the Dee formed some sort of a test which no coward could face: compare
the case of the discreet cauldron that would not boil meat for a
coward<a class="noteref" id="xd26e14293src" href="#xd26e14293" name=
"xd26e14293src">36</a>.</p>
<p>The <i lang="cy">dwy, dwyf, duiu</i>, of the river&rsquo;s Welsh
name represent an early form <i>d&#275;va</i> or <i>d&#275;iva</i>,
whence the Romans called their station on its banks <i>Deva</i>,
possibly as a shortening of <i lang="la">ad Devam</i>; but that
D&#275;va should have simply and directly meant the river is rendered
probable by the fact that Ptolemy elsewhere gives it as the name of the
northern Dee, which enters the sea near Aberdeen. From the same stem
were formed the names Dwyf-an and Dwyf-ach, which are treated in the
Triads as masculine and feminine respectively. In its course the Welsh
Dee receives a river Ceirw not far above Corwen, and that river flows
through farms called Ar-&#273;wyfan and Hendre&rsquo; Ar-&#273;wyfan,
and adjoining Ar&#273;wyfan is another farm called Foty Ar&#273;wyfan,
&lsquo;Shielings of Ar&#273;wyfan,&rsquo; while Hendre&rsquo;
Ar&#273;wyfan means the old stead or winter abode of Ar&#273;wyfan.
Ar&#273;wyfan itself would seem to mean &lsquo;On Dwyfan,&rsquo; and
Hendre&rsquo; Ar&#273;wyfan, which may be supposed the original
homestead, stands near a burn which flows into the Ceirw. That burn I
should suppose to have been the Dwyfan, and perhaps the name extended
to the Ceirw itself; but Dwyfan is not now known as the name
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb443" href="#v2pb443" name=
"v2pb443">443</a>]</span>of any stream in the neighbourhood. Elsewhere
we have two rivers called Dwyfor or Dwyfawr and Dwyfach, which unite a
little below the village of &#7930;an Ystumdwy; and from there to the
sea, the stream is called Dwyfor, the mouth of which is between
Criccieth and Afon Wen, in Carnarvonshire. Ystumdwy, commonly corrupted
into Stindwy, seems to mean <i lang="cy">Ystum-dwy</i>, &lsquo;the bend
of the Dwy&rsquo;; so that here also we have Dwyfach and Dwy, as in the
case of the Dee. Possibly Dwyfor was previously called simply Dwy or
even Dwyfan; but it is now explained as <i lang="cy">Dwy-fawr</i>,
&lsquo;great Dwy,&rsquo; which was most likely suggested by Dwyfach, as
this latter explains itself to the country people as <i lang=
"cy">Dwy-fach</i>, &lsquo;little Dwy.&rsquo; However, it is but right
to say that in &#7930;ywelyn ab Gruffy&#273;&rsquo;s grant of lands to
the monks of Aber Conwy they seem to be called Dwyuech and
Dwyuaur<a class="noteref" id="xd26e14340src" href="#xd26e14340" name=
"xd26e14340src">37</a>.</p>
<p>All these waters have in common the reputation of being liable to
sudden and dangerous floods, especially the Dwyfor, which drains Cwm
Stra&#7931;yn and its lake lying behind the great rocky barrier on the
left as one goes from Tremadoc towards Aber Glaslyn Bridge. Still more
so is this the case with the Dee and Bala Lake, which is wont to rise
at times from seven to nine feet above its ordinary level. The
inundation which then invades the valley from Bala down presents a
sight more magnificent than comfortable to contemplate. In fact nothing
could have been more natural than for the story elaborated by the
writer of certain of the late Triads to have connected the most
remarkable inundations with the largest piece of water in the
Principality, and one liable to such sudden changes of level: in other
words, that one should treat &#7930;yn &#7930;&iuml;on as merely
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb444" href="#v2pb444" name=
"v2pb444">444</a>]</span>one of the names of Bala Lake, now called in
Welsh &#7930;yn Tegid, and formerly sometimes &#7930;yn Aerfen.</p>
<p>While touching at p. 286 on Gwaen &#7930;ifon with its &#7930;yn
Pencraig as one of those claiming to be the &#7930;yn &#7930;&iuml;on
of the Triads, it was hinted that <i lang="cy">&#7930;&iuml;on</i> was
but a thinner form of <i lang="cy">&#7930;ifon</i>. Here one might
mention perhaps another &#7930;ifon, for which, however, no case could
be made. I allude to the name of the residence of the Wynns descended
from Gilmin Troed&#273;u, namely, Glyn &#7930;ifon, which means the
river &#7930;ifon&rsquo;s Glen; but one could not feel surprised if the
neighbouring &#7930;yfni, draining the lakes of Nant&#7931;e, should
prove to have once been also known as a &#7930;ifon, with the
Nant&#7931;e waters conforming by being called &#7930;yn &#7930;ifon.
But however that may be, one may say as to the flood caused by the
bursting of any such lake, that the notion of the universality of the
catastrophe was probably contributed by the author of Triad iii. 13,
from a non-Welsh source. He may have, however, not invented the vessel
in which he places Dwyfan and Dwyfach: at all events, one version of
the story of the Fan Fach represents the Lake Lady arriving in a boat.
As to the writer of the other Triad, iii. 97, he says nothing about
Dwyfan and his wife, but borrows Nefy&#273; Naf Neifion&rsquo;s ship to
save all that were to be saved; and here one may probably venture to
identify <i lang="cy">Nefy&#273;</i> with <i>Nemed</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e14369src" href="#xd26e14369" name=
"xd26e14369src">38</a>, genitive <i>Nemid</i>, a name borne in Irish
legend by a rover who is represented as one of the early colonizers of
Erin. As to the rest, the name Neifion by itself is used in Welsh for
Neptune and the sea, as in the following couplet of D. ab
Gwilym&rsquo;s poem lv:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>Nofiad a wnaeth hen Neifion</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>O Droia fawr draw i F&ocirc;n.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">It is old Neptune that has swam</p>
<p class="line">From great Troy afar to Mona.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb445" href="#v2pb445" name=
"v2pb445">445</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the same way <i lang="cy">M&ocirc;r Neifion</i>, &lsquo;Sea of
Neifion,&rsquo; seems to have signified the ocean, the high seas.</p>
<p>To return to the Triad about Dwyfan and Dwyfach, not only does it
make them from being water divinities into a man and woman, but there
is no certainty even that both were not feminine. In modern Welsh all
rivers are treated as feminine, and even Dyfrdwyf has usually to
submit, though the modern bard Tegid, analysing the word into <i lang=
"cy">Dwfr Dwyf</i>, &lsquo;Water of the Divinity or Divine
Water,&rsquo; where <i lang="cy">dwfr</i>, &lsquo;water,&rsquo; could
only be masculine, addressed &#7930;yn Tegid thus, p. 78:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>Drwyot, er dy&#273;iau&rsquo;r Drywon,</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>Y rhwyf y Dyfrdwyf ei don.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Through thee, from the days of the Druids,</p>
<p class="line">The Dwfr Dwyf impels his wave.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">This question, however, of the gender of river names,
or rather the sex which personification ascribed them, is a most
difficult one. If we glance at Ptolemy&rsquo;s Geography written in the
second century, we find in his account of the British Isles that he
names more than fifty of our river mouths and estuaries, and that he
divides their names almost equally into masculine and feminine. The
modern Welsh usage has, it is seen, departed far from this, but not so
far the folklore: the afanc is a male, and we have a figure of the same
sex appearing as the father of the lake maiden in the Fan Fach story,
and in that of &#7930;yn Du&rsquo;r Ar&#273;u; the same, too, was the
sex of the chief dweller of &#7930;yn Cwm &#7930;wch; the same remark
is applicable also to the greatest divinity of these islands&mdash;the
greatest, at any rate, so far as the scanty traces of his cult enable
one to become acquainted with him. As his name comes down into legend
it belongs here, as well as to the deities of antiquity, just as much,
in a sense, as the Dee. I refer to Nudons or Nodons, the
remains<a class="noteref" id="xd26e14424src" href="#xd26e14424" name=
"xd26e14424src">39</a> of whose sanctuary <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb446" href="#v2pb446" name="v2pb446">446</a>]</span>were many years
ago brought to light on a pleasant hill in Lydney Park, on the western
banks of the Severn. In the mosaic floor of the god&rsquo;s temple
there is a coloured inscription showing the expense of that part of the
work to have been defrayed by the contributions (<i lang="la">ex
stipibus</i>) of the faithful, and that it was carried out by two men,
of whom one appears to have been an officer in command of a naval force
guarding the coasts of the Severn Sea. In the midst of the mosaic
inscription is a round opening in the floor of nine inches in diameter
and surrounded by a broad band of red enclosed in two of blue. This has
given rise to various speculations, and among others that it was
intended for libations. The mosaics and the lettering of the
inscriptions seem to point to the third century as the time when the
sanctuary of Nudons was built under Roman auspices, though the place
was doubtless sacred to the god long before. In any case it fell in
exactly with the policy of the more astute of Roman statesmen to
encourage such a native cult as we find traces of in Lydney Park.</p>
<p>One of the inscriptions began with D. M. Nodonti, &lsquo;to the
great god Nudons,&rsquo; and a little bronze crescent intended for the
diadem of the god or of one of his priests gives a representation of
him as a crowned, beardless personage driving a chariot with four
horses; and on either side of him is a naked figure supposed to
represent the winds, and beyond them on each of the two sides is a
triton with the fore feet of a horse. The god holds the reins in his
left hand, and his right uplifted grasps what may be a sceptre or
possibly a whip, while the whole equipment of the god recalls in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb447" href="#v2pb447" name=
"v2pb447">447</a>]</span>some measure the Chariot of the Sun. Another
piece of the bronze ornament shows another triton with an anchor in one
of his hands, and opposite him a fisherman in the act of hooking a fine
salmon. Other things, such as oars and shell trumpets, together with
mosaic representations of marine animals in the floor of the temple,
compel us to assimilate Nudons more closely with Neptune than any other
god of classical mythology.</p>
<p>The name of the god, as given in the inscriptions, varies between
Nudons and Nodens, the cases actually occurring being the dative
Nodonti, Nodenti, and Nudente, and the genitive Nodentis, so I should
regard <i>&#333;</i> or <i>&#363;</i> as optional in the first
syllable, and <i>o</i> as preferable, perhaps, to <i>e</i> in the
second, for there is no room for reasonably doubting that we have here
to do with the same name as Irish <i>Nuadu</i>, genitive <i>Nuadat</i>,
conspicuous in the legendary history of Ireland. Now the Nuadu who
naturally occurs to one first, was Nuadu Argetl&aacute;m or Nuadu of
the Silver Hand, from <i>argat</i>, &lsquo;silver, <i lang=
"la">argentum</i>,&rsquo; and <i>l&aacute;m</i>, &lsquo;hand.&rsquo;
Irish literature explains how he came to have a hand made of silver,
and we can identify with him on Welsh ground a &#7930;u&#273;
&#7930;awereint; for put back as it were into earlier Brythonic, this
would be <i lang="cy">L&#363;do(ns)
L&#257;m&rsquo;-argenti&#815;os</i>: that is to say, a reversal takes
place in the order of the elements forming the epithet out of
<i>ereint</i> (for older <i>ergeint</i>), &lsquo;silvern,
<i>argenteus</i>,&rsquo; and <i>&#7931;aw</i>, for earlier
<i>l&#257;ma</i>, &lsquo;hand.&rsquo; Then comes the alliterative
instinct into play, forcing <i>N&#363;do(ns)
L&#257;margenti&#815;o(s)</i> to become <i>L&#363;do(ns)
L&#257;margenti&#815;o(s)</i>, whence the later form, <i lang=
"cy">&#7930;u&#273; &#7930;awereint</i>, derives regularly<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e14504src" href="#xd26e14504" name=
"xd26e14504src">40</a>. Thus we have in Welsh the name <i lang=
"cy">&#7930;&ucirc;&#273;</i>, fashioned into that form under the
influence of the epithet, whereas elsewhere it is <i lang=
"cy">N&ucirc;&#273;</i>, which occurs as a man&rsquo;s name in the
pedigrees, while an intermediate form was probably <i>N&#363;dos</i>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb448" href="#v2pb448" name=
"v2pb448">448</a>]</span>or <i>N&#363;do</i>, of which a genitive
<i>NVDI</i> occurs in a post-Roman inscription found near Yarrow Kirk
in Selkirkshire. It is worthy of note that the modification of
<i>N&#363;do</i> into <i>L&#363;do</i> must have taken place
comparatively early&mdash;not improbably while the language was still
Goidelic&mdash;as we seem to have a survival of the name in that of
<i>Lydney</i> itself.</p>
<p>It is very possible that we have <i>L&#363;do</i>, &#7930;u&#273;,
also in <i>Porthlu&#273;</i>; which Geoffrey of Monmouth gives, iii.
20, as the Welsh for Ludesgata or Ludgate, in London, which gate,
according to him, was called after an ancient king of Britain named
Lud. He seems to have been using an ancient tradition, and there would
be nothing improbable in the conjecture that Geoffrey&rsquo;s Lud was
our &#7930;u&#273;, and that the great water divinity of that name had
another sanctuary on the hill by the Thames, somewhere near the present
site of St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral, and occupying a post as it were
prophetic of Britain&rsquo;s rule of the water-ways in later times.</p>
<p>Perhaps as one seems to find traces of Nudons from the estuary of
the Thames to that of the Severn and thence to Ireland, one may
conclude that the god was one of the divinities worshipped by the
Goidels. With regard to the Brythonic Celts, there is nothing to
suggest that he belonged also to them except in the sense of his having
been probably adopted by them from the Goidels. It might be further
suggested that the Goidels themselves had in the first instance adopted
him from the pre-Celtic natives, but in that case a goddess would have
been rather more probable<a class="noteref" id="xd26e14547src" href=
"#xd26e14547" name="xd26e14547src">41</a>. In fact in the case of the
Severn we seem to have a trace of such a goddess in the Sabrina, Old
Welsh Habren, now Hafren, so called after a princess whom Geoffrey, ii.
5, represents drowned in the river: she may have been <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb449" href="#v2pb449" name=
"v2pb449">449</a>]</span>the pre-Celtic goddess of the Severn, and the
name corresponding to Welsh Hafren occurs in Ireland in the form of
Sabrann, an old name of the river Lee that flows through Cork.
Similarly one now reads sometimes of <i>Father</i> Thames after the
fashion of classic phraseology, and in the Celtic period Nudons may
have been closely identified with that river, but the ancient name
T&#259;m&#275;sa or T&#259;m&#275;sis<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e14558src" href="#xd26e14558" name="xd26e14558src">42</a> was
decidedly feminine, and it was, most likely, that of the river divinity
from times when the pre-Celtic natives held exclusive possession of
these islands. On the whole it appears safer to regard Nudons as
belonging to a race that had developed on a larger scale the idea of a
patriarchal or kingly ruler holding sway over a comparatively wide
area. So Nudons may here be treated as ruled out of the discussion as
to the origin of the fairies, to which a few paragraphs are now to be
devoted.</p>
<p>Speaking of the rank and file of the fairies in rather a promiscuous
fashion, one may say that we have found manifold proof of their close
connexion with the water-world. Not only have we found them supposed to
haunt places bordering on rivers, to live beneath the lakes, or to
inhabit certain green isles capable of playing hide-and-seek with the
ancient mariner, and perhaps not so very ancient either; but other
considerations have been suggested as also pointing unmistakably to the
same conclusion. Take for instance the indirect evidence <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb450" href="#v2pb450" name=
"v2pb450">450</a>]</span>afforded by the method of proceeding to
recover an infant stolen by the fairies. One account runs thus: The
mother who had lost her baby was to go with a wizard and carry with her
to a river the child left her in exchange. The wizard would say,
<i lang="cy">Crap ar y wrach</i>, &lsquo;Grip the hag,&rsquo; and the
woman would reply, <i lang="cy">Rhy hwyr, gyfraglach</i>, &lsquo;Too
late, you urchin<a class="noteref" id="xd26e14605src" href=
"#xd26e14605" name="xd26e14605src">43</a>.&rsquo; Before she uttered
those words she had dropped the urchin into the river, and she would
then return to her house. By that time the kidnapped child would be
found to have come back home<a class="noteref" id="xd26e14623src" href=
"#xd26e14623" name="xd26e14623src">44</a>. The words here used have not
been quite forgotten in Carnarvonshire, but no distinct meaning seems
to be attached to them now; at any rate I have failed to find anybody
who could explain them. I should however guess that the wizard
addressed his words to the fairy urchin with the intention, presumably,
that the fairies in the river should at the same time hear and note
what was about to be done. Another, and a somewhat more intelligible
version, is given in the <i lang="cy">Gwyliedy&#273;</i> for 1837, p.
185, by a contributor who publishes it from a manuscript which Lewis
Morris began to write in 1724 and finished apparently in 1729. He was a
native of Anglesey, and it is probably to that county the story
belongs, which he gives to illustrate one of the phonological aspects
of certain kinds of Welsh. That account differs from the one just cited
in that it introduces no <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb451" href=
"#v2pb451" name="v2pb451">451</a>]</span>wizard, but postulates two
fairy urchins between whom the dialogue occurs, which is not unusual in
our changeling stories: see p. 62. After this explanation I translate
Morris&rsquo; words thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But to return to the question of the words approaching to the
nature of the thing intended, there is an old story current among us
concerning a woman whose children had been exchanged by the <i lang=
"cy">Tylwyth Teg</i>. Whether it is truth or falsehood does not much
matter, yet it shows what the men of that age thought concerning the
sound of words, and how they fancied that the language of those sprites
was of a ghastly and lumpy kind. The story is as follows:&mdash;The
woman whose two children had been exchanged, chanced to overhear the
two <span class="corr" id="xd26e14643" title=
"Source: fair">fairy</span> heirs, whom she got instead of them,
reasoning with one another beyond what became their age and persons. So
she picked up the two sham children, one under each arm, in order to go
and throw them from a bridge into a river, that they might be drowned
as she fancied. But hardly had the one in his fall reached the bottom
when he cried out to his comrade in the following words:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>Grippiach greppiach</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>Dal d&rsquo;afel yn y wrach,</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>Hi aeth yn rhowyr &rsquo;faglach&mdash;</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>Mi eis i ir mwthlach<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e14663src" href="#xd26e14663" name=
"xd26e14663src">45</a>.&rsquo;</i></p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Grippiach Greppiach,</p>
<p class="line">Keep thy hold on the hag.</p>
<p class="line">It got too late, thou urchin&mdash;</p>
<p class="line">I fell into the&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">In spite of the obscurity of these words, it is quite
clear that it was thought the most natural thing in the world to return
the fairies to the river, and no sooner were <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb452" href="#v2pb452" name=
"v2pb452">452</a>]</span>they dropped there than the right infants were
found to have been sent home.</p>
<p>The same thing may be learned also from the story of the Curse of
Pantannas, pp. 187&ndash;8 above; for when the time of the
fairies&rsquo; revenge is approaching, the merry party gathered
together at Pantannas are frightened by a piercing voice rising from a
black and cauldron-like pool in the river; and after a while they hear
it a second time rising above the noise of the river as it cascades
over the shoulder of a neighbouring rock. Shortly afterwards an ugly,
diminutive woman appears on the table near the window, and had it not
been for the rudeness of one of those present she would have disclosed
the future to them, but, as it was, she said very little in a vague way
and went away offended; but as long as she was there the voice from the
river was silent. Here we have the Welsh counterpart of the <i>ben
s&iacute;de</i>, pronounced <i>banshee</i> in Anglo-Irish, and meaning
a fairy woman who is supposed to appear to certain Irish families
before deaths or other misfortunes about to befall them. It is
doubtless to some such fairy persons the voices belong, which threaten
vengeance on the heir of Pantannas and on the wicked prince and his
descendants previous to the cataclysm which brings a lake into the
place of a doomed city: witness such cases as those of &#7930;ynclys,
Syfa&#273;on, and Kenfig.</p>
<p>The last mentioned deserves some further scrutiny; and I take this
opportunity of referring the reader back to pp. 403&ndash;4, in order
to direct his attention to the fact that the voice so closely
identifies itself with the wronged family that it speaks in the first
person, as it cries, &lsquo;Vengeance is come on him who murdered my
father of the ninth generation!&rsquo; Now it is worthy of remark that
the same personifying is also characteristic of the Cyhiraeth<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e14712src" href="#xd26e14712" name=
"xd26e14712src">46</a>. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb453" href=
"#v2pb453" name="v2pb453">453</a>]</span>This spectral female used to
be oftener heard than seen; but her blood-freezing shriek was as a rule
to be heard when she came to a cross-road or to water, in which she
splashed with her hands. At the same time she would make the most
doleful noise and exclaim, in case the frightened hearer happened to be
a wife, <i lang="cy">Fy ngwr, fy ngwr!</i> &lsquo;my husband, my
husband!&rsquo; If it was the man the exclamation would be, <i lang=
"cy">Fy ngwraig, fy ngwraig!</i> &lsquo;my wife, my wife!&rsquo; Or in
either case it might be, <i lang="cy">Fy mhlentyn, fy mhlentyn, fy
mhlentyn bach!</i> &lsquo;my child, my child, my little child!&rsquo;
These cries meant the approaching death of the hearer&rsquo;s husband,
wife, or child, as the case might be; but if the scream was
inarticulate it was reckoned probable that the hearer himself was the
person foremourned. Sometimes she was supposed to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb454" href="#v2pb454" name=
"v2pb454">454</a>]</span>come, like the Irish banshee, in a dark mist
to the window of a person who has been long ailing, and to flap her
wings against the glass, while repeating aloud his or her name, which
was believed to mean that the patient must die<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e14819src" href="#xd26e14819" name="xd26e14819src">47</a>. The
picture usually given of the Cyhiraeth is of the most repellent kind:
tangled hair, long black teeth, wretched, skinny, shrivelled arms of
unwonted length out of all proportion to the body. Nevertheless it is,
in my opinion, but another aspect of the banshee-like female who
intervenes in the story of the Curse of Pantannas. One might perhaps
treat both as survivals of a belief in a sort of personification of, or
divinity identified with, a family or tribe, but for the fact that such
language is emptied of most of its meaning by the abstractions which it
would connect with a primitive state of society. So it is preferable,
as coming probably near the truth, to say that what we have here is a
trace of an ancestress. Such an idea of an ancestress as against that
of an ancestor is abundantly countenanced by dim figures like that of
the D&ocirc;n of the <i>Mabinogion</i>, and of her counterpart, after
whom the Tribes of the goddess Donu or Danu<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e14828src" href="#xd26e14828" name="xd26e14828src">48</a> are
known as <i lang="cy">Tuatha D&eacute; Danann</i> in Irish literature.
But the one who most provokes comparison is the Old Woman of Beare,
already mentioned, pp. 393&ndash;4: she figures largely in Irish
folklore as a hag surviving to see her descendants reckoned by tribes
and peoples. It may be only an accident that a poetically wrought
legend pictures her not so much interested in the fortunes of her
progeny as engaged in bewailing the unattractive appearance of her thin
arms and shrivelled hands, together with the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb455" href="#v2pb455" name=
"v2pb455">455</a>]</span>general wreck of the beauty which had been
hers some time or other centuries before.</p>
<p>However, the evidence of folklore is not of a kind to warrant our
building any heavy superstructure of theory on the supposition, that
the foundations are firmly held together by a powerful sense of
consistency or homogeneity. So I should hesitate to do anything so rash
as to pronounce the fairies to be all of one and the same origin: they
may well be of several. For instance, there may be those that have
grown out of traditions about an aboriginal pre-Celtic race, and some
may be the representatives of the ghosts of departed men and women,
regarded as one&rsquo;s ancestors; but there can hardly be any doubt
that others, and those possibly not the least interesting, have
originated in the demons and divinities&mdash;not all of ancestral
origin&mdash;with which the weird fancy of our remote forefathers
peopled lakes and streams, bays and creeks and estuaries. Perhaps it is
not too much to hope that the reader is convinced that in the course of
this chapter some interesting specimens have, so to say, been caught in
their native element, or else in the enjoyment of an amphibious life of
mirth and frolic, largely spent hard by sequestered lakes, near placid
rivers or babbling brooks. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb456" href=

our dictionary makers have taken into their heads to treat it as
<i>Tam&#277;sis</i> I know not. The Welsh is <i>Tafwys</i> with a
diphthong regularly representing an earlier long <i>e</i> or <i>ei</i>
in the second syllable. There is, as far as I know, no reason to
suppose <i>Tafwys</i> an invention, rather than a genuine vocable of
the same origin as the name of the Glamorganshire river <i>Taff</i>, in
Welsh <i>Taf</i>, which is also the name of the river emptying itself
at Laugharne, in Carmarthenshire. <i>Tafwys</i>, however, does not
appear to occur in any old Welsh document; but no such weakness
attaches to the testimony of the French <i>Tamise</i>, which could
hardly come from <i>Tam&#277;sis</i>: compare also the place-name
<i>Tamise</i> near the Scheldt in East Flanders; this, however, may be
of a wholly different origin.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

The meaning of the word <i>mwthlach</i> is doubtful, as it is now
current in Gwyne&#273; only in the sense of a soft, doughy, or puffy
person who is all of a heap, so to say. Pughe gives <i lang=
"cy">mwythlan</i> and <i lang="cy">mwythlen</i> with similar
significations. But <i lang="cy">mwthlach</i> would seem to have had
some such a meaning in the doggerel as that of rough ground or a place
covered with a scrubby, tangled growth. It is possibly the same word as
the Irish <i lang="cy">mothlach</i>, &lsquo;rough, bushy, ragged,
shaggy&rsquo;; see the <i>Vision of Laisr&eacute;n</i>, edited by

Howells, pp. 31&ndash;4, 56&ndash;7, who appears to have got uncertain
in his narrative as to the sex of the Cyhiraeth; but there is no reason
whatsoever for regarding it as either male or female&mdash;the latter
alone is warranted, as he might have gathered from her being called
<i lang="cy">y Gyhiraeth</i>, &lsquo;the Cyhiraeth,&rsquo; never
<i lang="cy">y Cyhiraeth</i> as far as I know. In North Cardiganshire
the spectre intended is known only by another name, that of <i lang=
"cy">Gwrach y Rhibyn</i>, but <i lang="cy">y Gyhiraeth</i> or <i lang=
"cy">yr hen Gyhiraeth</i> is a common term of abuse applied to a lanky,
cadaverous person, both there and in Gwyne&#273;; in books, however, it
is found sometimes meaning a phantom funeral. The word <i lang=
"cy">cyhiraeth</i> would seem to have originally meant a skeleton with
<i lang="cy">cyhyrau</i>, &lsquo;sinews,&rsquo; but no flesh. However,
<i lang="cy">cyhyrau</i>, singular <i lang="cy">cyhyr</i>, would be
more correctly written with an <i>i</i>; for the words are
pronounced&mdash;even in Gwyne&#273;&mdash;<i lang="cy">cyhir</i>,
<i lang="cy">cyhirau</i>. The spelling <i lang="cy">cyhyraeth</i>
corresponds to no pronunciation I have ever heard of the word; but
there is a third spelling, <i lang="cy">cyheuraeth</i>, which
corresponds to an actual <i lang="cy">cyhoereth</i> or <i lang=
"cy">cyhoyreth</i>, the colloquial pronunciation to be heard in parts
of South Wales: I cannot account for this variant. <i lang="cy">Gwrach
y Rhibyn</i> means the Hag of the <i lang="cy">Rhibyn</i>, and <i lang=
"cy">rhibyn</i> usually means a row, streak, a line&mdash;<i lang=
"cy">ma&rsquo; nhw&rsquo;n mynd yn un rhibyn</i>, &lsquo;they are going
in a line.&rsquo; But what exactly <i lang="cy">Gwrach y Rhibyn</i>
should connote I am unable to say. I may mention, however, on the
authority of Mr. Gwenogvryn Evans, that in Mid-Cardiganshire the term
<i lang="cy">Gwrach y Rhibyn</i> means a long roll or bustle of fern
tied with ropes of straw and placed along the middle of the top of a
hayrick. This is to form a ridge over which and on which the thatch is
worked and supported: <i lang="cy">gwrach</i> unqualified is, I am
told, used in this sense in Glamorganshire. Something about the
<i lang="cy">Gwrach</i> sprite will be found in the <i>Brython</i> for
1860, p. 23<sup>a</sup>, while a different account is given in
Jenkins&rsquo; <i>Be&#273; Gelert</i>, pp. 80&ndash;1.&nbsp;<a class=

<p class="first">In previous chapters sundry allusions have been made
to treasure caves besides that of Marchlyn Mawr, which has been given
at length on pp. 234&ndash;7 above. Here follow some more, illustrative
of this kind of folklore prevalent in Wales: they are difficult to
classify, but most of them mention treasure with or without sleeping
warriors guarding it. The others are so miscellaneous as to baffle any
attempt to characterize them generally and briefly. Take for instance a
cave in the part of Rhiwarth rock nearest to Cwm &#7930;anhafan, in the
neighbourhood of &#7930;angynog in Montgomeryshire. Into that,
according to Cyn&#273;elw in the <i>Brython</i> for 1860, p. 57, some
men penetrated as far as the pound of candles lasted, with which they
had provided themselves; but it appears to be tenanted by a hag who is
always busily washing clothes in a brass pan.</p>
<p>Or take the following, from J. H. Roberts&rsquo; essay, as given in
Welsh in Edwards&rsquo; <i lang="cy">Cymru</i> for 1897, p. 190: it
reminds one of an ordinary fairy tale, but it is not quite like any
other which I happen to know:&mdash;In the western end of the Arennig
Fawr there is a cave: in fact there <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb457" href="#v2pb457" name="v2pb457">457</a>]</span>are several
caves there, and some of them are very large too; but there is one to
which the finger of tradition points as an ancient abode of the
<i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i>. About two generations ago, the shepherds
of that country used to be enchanted by one of them called Mary, who
was remarkable for her beauty. Many an effort was made to catch her or
to meet her face to face, but without success, as she was too quick on
her feet. She used to show herself day after day, and she might be
seen, with her little harp, climbing the bare slopes of the mountain.
In misty weather when the days were longest in summer, the music she
made used to be wafted by the breeze to the ears of the love-sick
shepherds. Many a time had the boys of the Fi&#7931;tir Gerrig heard
sweet singing when passing the cave in the full light of day, but they
were subject to some spell, so that they never ventured to enter. But
the shepherd of Boch y Rhaiadr had a better view of the fairies one
Allhallows night (<i lang="cy">ryw noson <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e14878" title="Source: Galangaeaf">Calangaeaf</span></i>) when
returning home from a merry-making at Amno&#273;. On the sward in front
of the cave what should he see but scores of the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth
Teg</i> singing and dancing! He never saw another assembly in his life
so fair, and great was the trouble he had to resist being drawn into
their circles.</p>
<p>Let us now come to the treasure caves, and begin with <i>Ogof
Arthur</i>, &lsquo;Arthur&rsquo;s Cave,&rsquo; in the southern side of
Myny&#273; y Cnwc<a class="noteref" id="xd26e14889src" href=
"#xd26e14889" name="xd26e14889src">1</a> in the parish of
&#7930;angwyfan, on the south-western coast of Anglesey. The foot of
Myny&#273; y Cnwc is washed by the sea, and the mouth of the cave is
closed by its waters at high tide, but the cave, which <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb458" href="#v2pb458" name=
"v2pb458">458</a>]</span>is spacious, has a vent-hole in the side of
the mountain<a class="noteref" id="xd26e14919src" href="#xd26e14919"
name="xd26e14919src">2</a>. So it is at any rate reported in the
<i>Brython</i> for 1859, p. 138, by a writer who explored the place,
though not to the end of the mile which it is said to measure in
length. He mentions a local tradition, that it contains various
treasures, and that it temporarily afforded Arthur shelter in the
course of his wars with the <i>Gwy&#273;elod</i> or Goidels. But he
describes also a cromlech on the top of Myny&#273; y Cnwc, around which
there was a circle of stones, while within the latter there lies
buried, it is believed, an iron chest full of ancient gold. Various
attempts are said to have been made by the more greedy of the
neighbouring inhabitants to dig it up, but they have always been
frightened away by portents. Here then the guardians of the treasure
are creatures of a supernatural kind, as in many other instances, and
especially that of Dinas Emrys to be mentioned presently.</p>
<p>Next comes the first of a group of cave legends involving treasure
entrusted to the keeping of armed warriors. It is taken from Elijah
Waring&rsquo;s <i>Recollections and Anecdotes of Edward Williams</i>,
Iolo Morgannwg (London, 1850), pp. 95&ndash;8, where it is headed
&lsquo;A popular Tale in Glamorgan, by Iolo Morgannwg&rsquo;; a version
of it in Welsh will be found in the <i>Brython</i> for 1858, p. 162,
but Waring&rsquo;s version is in several respects better, and I give it
in his words:&mdash;&lsquo;A Welshman walking over London Bridge, with
a neat hazel staff in his hand, was accosted by an Englishman, who
asked him whence he came. &ldquo;I am from my own country,&rdquo;
answered the Welshman, in a churlish tone. &ldquo;Do not take it amiss,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb459" href="#v2pb459" name=
"v2pb459">459</a>]</span>my friend,&rdquo; said the Englishman;
&ldquo;if you will only answer my questions, and take my advice, it
will be of greater benefit to you than you imagine. That stick in your
hand grew on a spot under which are hid vast treasures of gold and
silver; and if you remember the place, and can conduct me to it, I will
put you in possession of those treasures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Welshman soon understood that the stranger was what he
called a cunning man, or conjurer, and for some time hesitated, not
willing to go with him among devils, from whom this magician must have
derived his knowledge; but he was at length persuaded to accompany him
into Wales; and going to Craig-y-Dinas [Rock of the Fortress], the
Welshman pointed out the spot whence he had cut the stick. It was from
the stock or root of a large old hazel: this they dug up, and under it
found a broad flat stone. This was found to close up the entrance into
a very large cavern, down into which they both went. In the middle of
the passage hung a bell, and the conjurer earnestly cautioned the
Welshman not to touch it. They reached the lower part of the cave,
which was very wide, and there saw many thousands of warriors lying
down fast asleep in a large circle, their heads outwards, every one
clad in bright armour, with their swords, shields, and other weapons
lying by them, ready to be laid hold on in an instant, whenever the
bell should ring and awake them. All the arms were so highly polished
and bright, that they illumined the cavern, as with the light of ten
thousand flames of fire. They saw amongst the warriors one greatly
distinguished from the rest by his arms, shield, battle-axe, and a
crown of gold set with the most precious stones, lying by his side.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In the midst of this circle of warriors they saw two
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb460" href="#v2pb460" name=
"v2pb460">460</a>]</span>very large heaps, one of gold, the other of
silver. The magician told the Welshman that he might take as much as he
could carry away of either the one or the other, but that he was not to
take from both the heaps. The Welshman loaded himself with gold: the
conjurer took none, saying that he did not want it, that gold was of no
use but to those who wanted knowledge, and that his contempt of gold
had enabled him to acquire that superior knowledge and wisdom which he
possessed. In their way out he cautioned the Welshman again not to
touch the bell, but if unfortunately he should do so, it might be of
the most fatal consequence to him, as one or more of the warriors would
awake, lift up his head, and ask <i>if it was day</i>. &ldquo;Should
this happen,&rdquo; said the cunning man, &ldquo;you must, without
hesitation, answer <i>No, sleep thou on</i>; on hearing which he will
again lay down his head and sleep.&rdquo; In their way up, however, the
Welshman, overloaded with gold, was not able to pass the bell without
touching it&mdash;it rang&mdash;one of the warriors raised up his head,
and asked, &ldquo;Is it day?&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered the
Welshman promptly, &ldquo;it is not, sleep thou on;&rdquo; so they got
out of the cave, laid down the stone over its entrance, and replaced
the hazel tree. The cunning man, before he parted from his companion,
advised him to be economical in the use of his treasure; observing that
he had, with prudence, enough for life: but that if by unforeseen
accidents he should be again reduced to poverty, he might repair to the
cave for more; repeating the caution, not to touch the bell if
possible, but if he should, to give the proper answer, <i>that it was
not day</i>, as promptly as possible. He also told him that the
distinguished person they had seen was <span class="sc">Arthur</span>,
and the others his warriors; and they lay there asleep with their arms
ready at hand, for the dawn of that day when the <i>Black Eagle</i> and
the <i>Golden <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb461" href="#v2pb461"
name="v2pb461">461</a>]</span>Eagle</i> should go to war, the loud
clamour of which would make the earth tremble so much, that the bell
would ring loudly, and the warriors awake, take up their arms, and
destroy all the enemies of the Cymry, who afterwards should repossess
the Island of Britain, re-establish their own king and government at
Caer&#7931;eon, and be governed with justice, and blessed with peace so
long as the world endures.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The time came when the Welshman&rsquo;s treasure was all
spent: he went to the cave, and as before overloaded himself. In his
way out he touched the bell: it rang: a warrior lifted up his head,
asking if it was day, but the Welshman, who had covetously overloaded
himself, being quite out of breath with labouring under his burden, and
withal struck with terror, was not able to give the necessary answer;
whereupon some of the warriors got up, took the gold away from him, and
beat him dreadfully. They afterwards threw him out, and drew the stone
after them over the mouth of the cave. The Welshman never recovered the
effects of that beating, but remained almost a cripple as long as he
lived, and very poor. He often returned with some of his friends to
Craig-y-Dinas; but they could never afterwards find the spot, though
they dug over, seemingly, every inch of the hill.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This story of Iolo&rsquo;s closes with a moral, which I omit in
order to make room for what he says in a note to the effect, that there
are two hills in Glamorganshire called Craig-y-Dinas&mdash;nowadays the
more usual pronunciation in South Wales is Craig y &#272;inas&mdash;one
in the parish of &#7930;antrissant and the other in Ystrad Dyfodwg.
There was also a hill so called, Iolo says, in the Vale of Towy, not
far from Carmarthen. He adds that in Glamorgan the tale is related of
the Carmarthenshire hill, while in Carmarthenshire the hill is said to
be in Glamorgan. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb462" href="#v2pb462"
name="v2pb462">462</a>]</span>According to Iolo&rsquo;s son, Taliesin
Williams<a class="noteref" id="xd26e14972src" href="#xd26e14972" name=
"xd26e14972src">3</a> or Taliesin ab Iolo, the Craig y &#272;inas with
which the Cave of Arthur (or Owen Lawgoch) is associated is the one on
the borders of Glamorgan and Brecknockshire. That is also the opinion
of my friend Mr. Reynolds, who describes this <i>craig</i> and
<i>dinas</i> as a very bold rocky eminence at the top of the Neath
Valley, near Pont Ne&#273; Fechan. He adds that in this tale as related
to his mother &lsquo;in her very young days&rsquo; by a very old woman,
known as Mari Shencin y Clochy&#273; &lsquo;Jenkin the Sexton&rsquo;s
Mary,&rsquo; the place of Arthur was taken by Owen Lawgoch, &lsquo;Owen
of the Red Hand,&rsquo; of whom more anon.</p>
<p>The next Arthurian story is not strictly in point, for it makes no
allusion to treasure; but as it is otherwise so similar to Iolo&rsquo;s
tale I cannot well avoid introducing it here. It is included in the
composite story of <i lang="cy">Bwca &rsquo;r Trwyn</i>, &lsquo;the
Bogie of the Nose,&rsquo; written out for me in Gwentian Welsh by Mr.
Craigfryn Hughes. The cave portion relates how a Monmouthshire farmer,
whose house was grievously troubled by the bogie, set out one morning
to call on a wizard who lived near Caerleon, and how he on his way came
up with a very strange and odd man who wore a three-cornered hat. They
fell into conversation, and the strange man asked the farmer if he
should like to see something of a wonder. He answered he would.
&lsquo;Come with me then,&rsquo; said the wearer of the cocked hat,
&lsquo;and you shall see what nobody else alive to-day has seen.&rsquo;
When they had reached the middle of a wood this spiritual guide sprang
from horseback and kicked a big stone near the road. It instantly moved
aside to disclose the mouth of a large cave; and now said he to the
farmer, &lsquo;Dismount and bring your horse in here: tie him up
alongside of mine, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb463" href=
"#v2pb463" name="v2pb463">463</a>]</span>and follow me so that you may
see something which the eyes of man have not beheld for
centuries.&rsquo; The farmer, having done as he was ordered, followed
his guide for a long distance: they came at length to the top of a
flight of stairs, where two huge bells were hanging. &lsquo;Now
mind,&rsquo; said the warning voice of the strange guide, &lsquo;not to
touch either of those bells.&rsquo; At the bottom of the stairs there
was a vast chamber with hundreds of men lying at full length on the
floor, each with his head reposing on the stock of his gun. &lsquo;Have
you any notion who these men are?&rsquo; &lsquo;No,&rsquo; replied the
farmer, &lsquo;I have not, nor have I any idea what they want in such a
place as this.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the guide, &lsquo;these
are Arthur&rsquo;s thousand soldiers reposing and sleeping till the
Kymry have need of them. Now let us get out as fast as our feet can
carry us.&rsquo; When they reached the top of the stairs, the farmer
somehow struck his elbow against one of the bells so that it rang, and
in the twinkling of an eye all the sleeping host rose to their feet
shouting together, &lsquo;Are the Kymry in straits?&rsquo; &lsquo;Not
yet: sleep you on,&rsquo; replied the wearer of the cocked hat,
whereupon they all dropped down on their guns to resume their slumbers
at once. &lsquo;These are the valiant men,&rsquo; he went on to say,
&lsquo;who are to turn the scale in favour of the Kymry when the time
comes for them to cast the Saxon yoke off their necks and to recover
possession of their country.&rsquo; When the two had returned to their
horses at the mouth of the cave, his guide said to the farmer,
&lsquo;Now go in peace, and let me warn you on the pain of death not to
utter a syllable about what you have seen for the space of a year and a
day: if you do, woe awaits you.&rsquo; After he had moved the stone
back to its place the farmer lost sight of him. When the year had
lapsed the farmer happened to pass again that way, but, though he made
a long and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb464" href="#v2pb464" name=
"v2pb464">464</a>]</span>careful search, he failed completely to find
the stone at the mouth of the cave.</p>
<p>To return to Iolo&rsquo;s yarn, one may say that there are traces of
his story as at one time current in Merionethshire, but with the
variation that the Welshman met the wizard not on London Bridge but at
a fair at Bala, and that the cave was somewhere in Merioneth: the hero
was Arthur, and the cave was known as Ogof Arthur. Whether any such
cave is still known I cannot tell; but a third and interestingly told
version is given in the <i>Brython</i> for 1858, p. 179, by the late
Gwyniony&#273;, who gives the story as the popular belief in his native
parish of Troed yr Aur, halfway between Newcastle Emlyn and Aber Porth,
in South Cardiganshire. In this last version the hero is not Arthur,
but the later man as follows:&mdash;Not the least of the wonders of
imagination wont to exercise the minds of the old people was the story
of Owen Lawgoch. One sometimes hears sung in our fairs the
words:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>Yr Owain hwn yw Harri &rsquo;r Nawfed</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>Sy&#273; yn trigo &rsquo;ngwlad estronied,
&amp;c.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">This Owen is Henry the Ninth,</p>
<p class="line">Who tarries in a foreign land, &amp;c.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">But this Owen Lawgoch, the national deliverer of our
ancient race of Brythons, did not, according to the Troed yr Aur
people, tarry in a foreign land, but somewhere in Wales, not far from
Offa&rsquo;s Dyke. They used to say that one Dafy&#273; Meirig of
Bettws Bledrws, having quarrelled with his father, left for
&#7930;oegr<a class="noteref" id="xd26e15013src" href="#xd26e15013"
name="xd26e15013src">4</a>, &lsquo;England.&rsquo; When he had got a
considerable distance from home, he struck a bargain with a cattle
dealer to drive a herd of his beasts to London. Somewhere at the corner
of a vast moor Dafy&#273; cut a very remarkable hazel stick; for a good
staff is as essential to the vocation of a good drover as <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb465" href="#v2pb465" name=
"v2pb465">465</a>]</span>teeth are to a dog. So while his comrades had
had their sticks broken before reaching London, Dafy&#273;&rsquo;s
remained as it was, and whilst they were conversing together on London
Bridge a stranger accosted Dafy&#273;, wishing to know where he had
obtained that wonderful stick. He replied that it was in Wales he had
had it, and on the stranger&rsquo;s assuring him that there were
wondrous things beneath the tree on which it had grown, they both set
out for Wales. When they reached the spot and dug a little they found
that there was a great hollow place beneath. As night was spreading out
her sable mantle, and as they were getting deeper, what should they
find but stairs easy to step and great lamps illumining the vast
chamber! They descended slowly, with mixed emotions of dread and
invincible desire to see the place. When they reached the bottom of the
stairs, they found themselves near a large table, at one end of which
they beheld sitting a tall man of about seven foot. He occupied an
old-fashioned chair and rested his head on his left hand, while the
other hand, all red, lay on the table and grasped a great sword. He was
withal enjoying a wondrously serene sleep; and at his feet on the floor
lay a big dog. After casting a glance at them, the wizard said to
Dafy&#273;: &lsquo;This is Owen Lawgoch, who is to sleep on till a
special time, when he will wake and reign over the Brythons. That
weapon in his hand is one of the swords of the ancient kings of
Prydain. No battle was ever lost in which that sword was used.&rsquo;
Then they moved slowly on, gazing at the wonders of that subterranean
chamber; and they beheld everywhere the arms of ages long past, and on
the table thousands of gold pieces bearing the images of the different
kings of Prydain. They got to understand that it was permitted them to
take a handful of each, but not to put any in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb466" href="#v2pb466" name=
"v2pb466">466</a>]</span>their purses. They both visited the cave
several times, but at last Dafy&#273; put in his purse a little of the
gold bearing the image of one of the bravest of Owen&rsquo;s ancestors.
But after coming out again they were never able any more to find
Owen&rsquo;s subterranean palace.</p>
<p>Those are, says Gwyniony&#273;, the ideas cherished by the old
people of Troed yr Aur in Keredigion, and the editor adds a note that
the same sort of story is current among the peasantry of Cumberland,
and perhaps of other parts of Britain. This remark will at once recall
to the reader&rsquo;s mind the well-known verses<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e15022src" href="#xd26e15022" name="xd26e15022src">5</a> of the
Scottish poet, Leyden, as to Arthur asleep in a cave in the Eildon
Hills in the neighbourhood of Melrose Abbey. But he will naturally ask
why London Bridge is introduced into this and Iolo&rsquo;s story, and
in answer I have to say, firstly, that London Bridge formerly loomed
very large in the popular imagination as one of the chief wonders of
London, itself the most wonderful city in the world. Such at any rate
was the notion cherished as to London and London Bridge by the country
people of Wales, even within my own memory. Secondly, the fashion of
selecting London Bridge as the opening scene of a treasure legend had
been set, perhaps, by a widely spread English story to the following
effect:&mdash;A certain pedlar of Swaffham in Norfolk had a dream, that
if he went and stood on London Bridge he would have very joyful news;
as the dream was doubled and trebled he decided to go. So he stood on
the bridge two or three days, when at last a shopkeeper, observing that
he loitered there so long, neither offering anything for sale nor
asking for alms, inquired of him as to his business. The pedlar told
him his errand, and was heartily laughed at by the shopkeeper, who said
that he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb467" href="#v2pb467" name=
"v2pb467">467</a>]</span>had dreamt that night that he was at a place
called Swaffham in Norfolk, and that if he only dug under a great oak
tree in an orchard behind a pedlar&rsquo;s house there, he would find a
vast treasure; but the place was utterly unknown to him, and he was not
such a fool as to follow a silly dream. No, he was wiser than that; so
he advised the pedlar to go home to mind his business. The pedlar very
quietly took in the words as to the dream, and hastened home to
Swaffham, where he found the treasure in his own orchard. The rest of
the story need not be related here, as it is quite different from the
Welsh ones, which the reader has just had brought under his
notice<a class="noteref" id="xd26e15036src" href="#xd26e15036" name=
"xd26e15036src">6</a>.</p>
<p>To return to Owen Lawgoch, for we have by no means done with him: on
the farm of Cil yr Ychen there stands a remarkable limestone hill
called <i lang="cy">y &#272;inas</i>, &lsquo;the Fortress,&rsquo;
hardly a mile to the north of the village of &#7930;andyb&iuml;e, in
Carmarthenshire. This <i lang="cy">dinas</i> and the lime-kilns that
are gradually consuming it are to be seen on the right from the railway
as you go from &#7930;andeilo to &#7930;andyb&iuml;e. It is a steep
high rock which forms a very good natural fortification, and in the
level area on the top is the mouth of a very long cavern, known as
<i lang="cy">Ogo&rsquo;r &#272;inas</i>, &lsquo;the Dinas Cave.&rsquo;
The entrance into it is small and low, but it gradually widens out,
becoming in one place lofty and roomy with several smaller branch caves
leading out of it; and it is believed that some of them connect
Ogo&rsquo;r &#272;inas with smaller caves at Pant y &#7930;yn,
&lsquo;the Lake Hollow,&rsquo; where, as the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb468" href="#v2pb468" name=
"v2pb468">468</a>]</span>name indicates, there is a small lake a little
higher up: both Ogo&rsquo;r &#272;inas and Pant y &#7930;yn are within
a mile of the village of &#7930;andyb&iuml;e<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e15058src" href="#xd26e15058" name="xd26e15058src">7</a>. Now I am
informed, in a letter written in 1893 by one native, that the local
legend about Ogo&rsquo;r &#272;inas is that Owen Lawgoch and his men
are lying asleep in it, while another native, Mr. Fisher, writing in
the same year, but on the authority of somewhat later hearsay,
expresses himself as follows:&mdash;&lsquo;I remember hearing two
traditions respecting Ogo&rsquo;r &#272;inas: (1) that King Arthur and
his warriors lie sleeping in it with their right hands clasping the
hilts of their drawn swords ready to encounter anyone who may venture
to disturb their repose&mdash;is there not a <i lang="cy">dinas</i>
somewhere in Carnarvonshire with a similar legend? (2) That Owen
Lawgoch lived in it some time or other: that is all that I remember
having heard about him in connection with this <i lang=
"cy">ogof</i>.&rsquo; Mr. Fisher proceeds, moreover, to state that it
is said of an <i lang="cy">ogof</i> at Pant y &#7930;yn, that Owen
Lawgoch and his men on a certain occasion took refuge in it, where they
were shut up and starved to death. He adds that, however this may be,
it is a fact that in the year 1813 ten or more human skeletons of
unusual stature were discovered in an <i lang="cy">ogof</i>
there<a class="noteref" id="xd26e15080src" href="#xd26e15080" name=
"xd26e15080src">8</a>. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb469" href=
"#v2pb469" name="v2pb469">469</a>]</span></p>
<p>To this I may append a reference to the <i>Geninen</i> for 1896, p.
84, where Mr. &#7930;eufer Thomas, who is also a native of the
district, alludes to the local belief that Owen Lawgoch and his men are
asleep, as already mentioned, in the cave of Pant y &#7930;yn, and that
they are to go on sleeping there till a trumpet blast and the clash of
arms on Rhiw Goch rouse them to sally forth to combat the Saxons and to
conquer, as set forth by Howells: see p. 381 above. It is needless to
say that there is no reason, as will be seen presently, to suppose Owen
Lawgoch to have ever been near any of the caves to which allusion has
here been made; but that does not appreciably detract from the
fascination of the legend which has gathered round his personality; and
in passing I may be allowed to express my surprise that in such stories
as these the earlier Owen has not been eclipsed by Owen Glyndwr: there
must be some historical reason why that has not taken place. Can it be
that a habit of caution made Welshmen speak of Owen Lawgoch when the
other Owen was really meant?</p>
<p>The passage I have cited from Mr. Fisher&rsquo;s letter raises the
question of a <i lang="cy">dinas</i> in Carnarvonshire, which that of
his native parish recalled to his mind; and this is to be considered
next. Doubtless he meant <i lang="cy">Dinas Emrys</i> formerly called
<i lang="cy">Din Emreis</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e15107src" href=
"#xd26e15107" name="xd26e15107src">9</a>, &lsquo;the Fortress of
Ambrosius,&rsquo; situated near Be&#273;gelert, and known in the
neighbourhood simply as <i lang="cy">y Dinas</i>, &lsquo;the
Fort.&rsquo; It is celebrated in the Vortigern legend as the place
where the dragons had been hidden, that frustrated the building
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb470" href="#v2pb470" name=
"v2pb470">470</a>]</span>of that king&rsquo;s castle; and the spot is
described in Lewis&rsquo; <i>Topographical Dictionary of Wales</i>, in
the article on <i>Bethgelart</i> (<i>Be&#273;-Celert</i>), as an
isolated rocky eminence with an extensive top area, which is defended
by walls of loose stones, and accessible only on one side. He adds that
the entrance appears to have been guarded by two towers, and that
within the enclosed area are the foundations of circular buildings of
loose stones forming walls of about five feet in thickness. Concerning
that Dinas we read in the <i>Brython</i> for 1861, p. 329, a legend to
the following effect:&mdash;Now after the departure of Vortigern,
Myr&#273;in, or Merlin as he is called in English, remained himself in
the Dinas for a long time, until, in fact, he went away with Emrys
Ben-aur, &lsquo;Ambrosius the Gold-headed&rsquo;&mdash;evidently
Aurelius Ambrosius is meant. When he was about to set out with the
latter, he put all his treasure and wealth into a <i lang="cy">crochan
aur</i>, &lsquo;a gold cauldron,&rsquo; and hid it in a cave in the
Dinas, and on the mouth of the cave he rolled a huge stone, which he
covered up with earth and sods, so that it was impossible for any one
to find it. He intended this wealth to be the property of some special
person in a future generation, and it is said that the heir to it is to
be a youth with yellow hair and blue eyes. When that one comes near to
the Dinas a bell will ring to invite him to the cave, which will open
of itself as soon as his foot touches it. Now the fact that some such
legend was once currently believed about Be&#273;gelert and Nanhwynain
is proved by the curious stories as to various attempts made to find
the treasure, and the thunderstorms and portents which used to vanquish
the local greed for gold. For several instances in point see the
<i>Brython</i>, pp. 329&ndash;30; and for others, showing how hidden
treasure is carefully reserved for the right sort of heir, see p. 148
above. To prove how widely this idea prevailed in Carnarvonshire,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb471" href="#v2pb471" name=
"v2pb471">471</a>]</span>I may add a short story which Mrs.
Williams-Ellis of Glasfryn got from the engineer who told her of the
sacred eel of &#7930;angybi (p. 366):&mdash;There was on Pentyrch, the
hill above &#7930;angybi, he said, a large stone so heavy and fixed so
fast in the ground that no horses, no men could move it: it had often
been tried. One day, however, a little girl happened to be playing by
the stone, and at the touch of her little hand the stone moved. A hoard
of coins was found under it, and that at a time when the little
girl&rsquo;s parents happened to be in dire need of it. Search had long
been made by undeserving men for treasure supposed to be hidden at that
spot; but it was always unsuccessful until the right person touched the
stone to move. The failure of the wrong person to secure the treasure,
even when discovered, is illustrated by a story given by Mr. Derfel
Hughes in his <i>Antiquities of &#7930;andegai and
&#7930;an&#7931;echid</i>, pp. 35&ndash;6, to the effect that a servant
man, somewhere up among the mountains near Ogwen Lake, chanced to come
across the mouth of a cave with abundance of vessels of brass
(<i>pres</i>) of every shape and description within it. He went at once
and seized one of them, but, alas! it was too heavy for him to stir it.
So he resolved to go away and return early on the morrow with a friend
to help him; but before going he closed the mouth of the cave with
stones and sods so as to leave it safe. While thus engaged he
remembered having heard how others had like him found caves and failed
to refind them. He could procure nothing readily that would satisfy him
as a mark, so it occurred to him to dot his path with the chippings of
his stick, which he whittled all the way as he went back until he came
to a familiar track: the chips were to guide him back to the cave. So
when the morning came he and his friend set out, but when they reached
the point where the chips should <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb472"
href="#v2pb472" name="v2pb472">472</a>]</span>begin, not one was to be
seen: the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i> had picked up every one of them.
So that discovery of articles of brass&mdash;more probably
bronze&mdash;was in vain. But, says the writer, it is not fated to be
always in vain, for there is a tradition in the valley that it is a
Gwy&#273;el, &lsquo;Goidel, Irishman,&rsquo; who is to have these
treasures, and that it will happen in this wise:&mdash;A Gwy&#273;el
will come to the neighbourhood to be a shepherd, and one day when he
goes up the mountain to see to the sheep, just when it pleases the
fates a black sheep with a speckled head will run before him and make
straight for the cave: the sheep will go in, with the Gwy&#273;el in
pursuit trying to catch him. When the Gwy&#273;el enters he sees the
treasures, looks at them with surprise, and takes possession of them;
and thus, in some generation to come, the Gwy&#273;yl will have their
own restored to them. That is the tradition which Derfel Hughes found
in the vale of the Ogwen, and he draws from it the inference which it
seems to warrant, in words to the following effect:&mdash;Perhaps this
shows us that the Gwy&#273;yl had some time or other something to do
with these parts, and that we are not to regard as stories without
foundations all that is said of that nation; and the sayings of old
people to this day show that there is always some spite between our
nation and the Gwy&#273;yl. Thus, for instance, he goes on to say, if a
man proves changeable, he is said to have become a Gwy&#273;el
(<i lang="cy">Y mae wedi troi&rsquo;n Wy&#273;el</i>), or if one is
very shameless and cheeky he is called a Gwy&#273;el and told to hold
his tongue (<i lang="cy">Taw yr hen Wy&#273;el</i>); and a number of
such locutions used by our people proves, he thinks, the former
prevalence of much contention between the two sister-nations.
Expressions of the kind mentioned by Mr. Hughes are well known in all
parts of the Principality, and it is difficult to account for them
except on the supposition <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb473" href=
"#v2pb473" name="v2pb473">473</a>]</span>that Goidels and Brythons
lived for a long time face to face, so to say, with one another over
large areas in the west of our island.</p>
<p>The next story to be mentioned belongs to the same Snowdonian
neighbourhood, and brings us back to Arthur and his Men. For a writer
who has already been quoted from the <i>Brython</i> for 1861, p. 331,
makes Arthur and his following set out from Dinas Emrys and cross Hafod
y Borth mountain for a place above the upper reach of Cwm&#7931;an,
called Tregalan, where they found their antagonists. From Tregalan the
latter were pushed up the <i lang="cy">bwlch</i> or pass, towards Cwm
Dyli; but when the vanguard of the army with Arthur leading had reached
the top of the pass, the enemy discharged a shower of arrows at them.
There Arthur fell, and his body was buried in the pass so that no enemy
might march that way so long as Arthur&rsquo;s dust rested there. That,
he says, is the story, and there to this day remains in the pass, he
asserts, the heap of stones called <i>Carne&#273; Arthur</i>,
&lsquo;Arthur&rsquo;s Cairn&rsquo;: the pass is called <i lang=
"cy">Bwlch y Saethau</i>, &lsquo;the Pass of the Arrows.&rsquo; Then
Ogof &#7930;anciau Eryri is the subject of the following story given at
p. 371 of the same volume:&mdash;After Arthur&rsquo;s death on Bwlch y
Saethau, his men ascended to the ridge of the &#7930;iwe&#273; and
descended thence into a vast cave called <i lang="cy">Ogof
&#7930;anciau Eryri</i>, &lsquo;the young Men of Snowdonia&rsquo;s
Cave,&rsquo; which is in the precipitous cliff on the left-hand side
near the top of &#7930;yn &#7930;ydaw. This is in Cwm Dyli, and there
in that cave those warriors are said to be still, sleeping in their
armour and awaiting the second coming of Arthur to restore the crown of
Britain to the Kymry. For the saying is:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>&#7930;ancia&rsquo; &rsquo;Ryri a&rsquo;u gwyn
gy&#7931; a&rsquo;i henni&#7931; hi.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Snowdonia&rsquo;s youths with their white hazels will
win it.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">As the local shepherds were one day long ago
collecting <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb474" href="#v2pb474" name=
"v2pb474">474</a>]</span>their sheep on the &#7930;iwe&#273;, one sheep
fell down to a shelf in this precipice, and when the Cwm Dyli shepherd
made his way to the spot he perceived that the ledge of rock on which
he stood led to the hidden cave of &#7930;anciau Eryri. There was light
within: he looked in and beheld a host of warriors without number all
asleep, resting on their arms and ready equipped for battle. Seeing
that they were all asleep, he felt a strong desire to explore the whole
place; but as he was squeezing in he struck his head against the bell
hanging in the entrance. It rang so that every corner of the immense
cave rang again, and all the warriors woke uttering a terrible shout,
which so frightened the shepherd that he never more enjoyed a
day&rsquo;s health; nor has anybody since dared as much as to approach
the mouth of the cave.</p>
<p>Thus far the <i>Brython</i>, and I have only to remark that this
legend is somewhat remarkable for the fact of its representing the
Youths of Eryri sleeping away in their cave without Arthur among them.
In fact, that hero is described as buried not very far off beneath a
<i lang="cy">carne&#273;</i> or cairn on Bwlch y Saethau. As to the
exact situation of that cairn, I may say that my attention was drawn
some time ago to the following lines by Mr. William Owen, better known
as Glaslyn, a living bard bred and born in the district:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>Ger&#7931;aw Carne&#273; Arthur ar ysgwy&#273; y
Wy&#273;fa</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>Y gorwe&#273; gwe&#273;i&#7931;ion y cawr enwog

</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Near Arthur&rsquo;s Cairn on the shoulder of
Snowdon</p>
<p class="line">Lie the remains of the famous giant Ricca.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">These words recall an older couplet in a poem by Rhys
Goch Eryri, who is said to have died in the year 1420. He was a native
of the parish of Be&#273;gelert, and his words in point run
thus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>Ar y drum oer dramawr,</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>Yno gorwe&#273; Ricca Gawr.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">On the ridge cold and vast,</p>
<p class="line">There the Giant Ricca lies.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb475" href="#v2pb475" name=
"v2pb475">475</a>]</span></p>
<p>From this it is clear that Rhys Goch meant that the cairn on the top
of Snowdon covered the remains of the giant whose name has been
variously written Ricca, Ritta, and Rhita. So I was impelled to
ascertain from Glaslyn whether I had correctly understood his lines,
and he has been good enough to help me out of some of my difficulties,
as I do not know Snowdon by heart, especially the Nanhwynain and
Be&#273;gelert side of the mountain:&mdash;The cairn on the summit of
Snowdon was the Giant&rsquo;s before it was demolished and made into a
sort of tower which existed before the hotel was made. Glaslyn has not
heard it called after Ricca&rsquo;s name, but he states that old people
used to call it <i lang="cy">Carne&#273; y Cawr</i>, &lsquo;the
Giant&rsquo;s Cairn.&rsquo; In 1850 <i>Carne&#273; Arthur</i>,
&lsquo;Arthur&rsquo;s Cairn,&rsquo; was to be seen on the top of Bwlch
y Saethau, but he does not know whether it is still so, as he has not
been up there since the building of the hotel. Bwlch y Saethau is a
lofty shoulder of Snowdon extending in the direction of Nanhwynain, and
the distance from the top of Snowdon to it is not great; it would take
you half an hour or perhaps a little more to walk from the one <i lang=
"cy">carne&#273;</i> to the other. It is possible to trace
Arthur&rsquo;s march from Dinas Emrys up the slopes of Hafod y Borth,
over the shoulder of the Aran and Braich yr Oen to Tregalan&mdash;or
Cwm Tregalan, as it is now called&mdash;but from Tregalan he would have
to climb in a north-easterly direction in order to reach Bwlch y
Saethau, where he is related to have fallen and to have been interred
beneath a cairn. This may be regarded as an ordinary or commonplace
account of his death. But the scene suggests a far more romantic
picture; for down below was &#7930;yn &#7930;ydaw with its sequestered
isle, connected then by means only of a primitive canoe with a shore
occupied by men engaged in working the ore of Eryri. Nay with the eyes
of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb476" href="#v2pb476" name=
"v2pb476">476</a>]</span>Malory we seem to watch Bedivere making, with
Excalibur in his hands, his three reluctant journeys to the lake ere he
yielded it to the arm emerging from the deep. We fancy we behold how
&lsquo;euyn fast by the banke houed a lytyl barge wyth many fayr ladyes
in hit,&rsquo; which was to carry the wounded Arthur away to the
accompaniment of mourning and loud lamentation; but the legend of the
Marchlyn bids us modify Malory&rsquo;s language as to the barge
containing many ladies all wearing black hoods, and take our last look
at the warrior departing rather in a coracle with three wondrously fair
women attending to his wounds<a class="noteref" id="xd26e15267src"
href="#xd26e15267" name="xd26e15267src">10</a>.</p>
<p>Some further notes on Snowdon, together with a curious account of
the Cave of &#7930;anciau Eryri, have been kindly placed at my disposal
by Mr. Ellis Pierce (Elis<a class="noteref" id="xd26e15275src" href=
"#xd26e15275" name="xd26e15275src">11</a> o&rsquo;r Nant) of
Dolwy&#273;elan:&mdash;In the uppermost part of the hollow called
Cwm&#7931;an is Tregalan, and in the middle of Cwm Tregalan is a green
hill, or rather an eminence which hardly forms a hill, but what is
commonly called a <i lang="cy">boncyn</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e15340src" href="#xd26e15340" name="xd26e15340src">12</a> in
Carnarvonshire, and between that green <i lang="cy">boncyn</i> and the
<i lang="cy">Clogwyn Du</i>, &lsquo;Black Precipice,&rsquo; is a bog,
the depth of which no one has ever succeeded in ascertaining, and a
town&mdash;inferred perhaps from <i lang="cy">tre</i> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb477" href="#v2pb477" name=
"v2pb477">477</a>]</span>in <i>Tregalan</i>&mdash;is fabled to have
been swallowed up there. Another of my informants speaks of several
hillocks or <i>boncyns</i> as forming one side of this little <i lang=
"cy">cwm</i>; but he has heard from geologists, that these green mounds
represent moraines deposited there in the glacial period. From the
bottom of the Clogwyn Du it is about a mile to Bwlch y Saethau. Then as
to the cave of &#7930;anciau Eryri, which nobody can now find, the
slope down to it begins from the top of the &#7930;iwe&#273;, but
ordinarily speaking one could not descend to where it is supposed to
have been without the help of ropes, which seems incompatible with the
story of the Cwm Dyli shepherd following a sheep until he was at the
mouth of the cave; not to mention the difficulty which the descent
would have offered to Arthur&rsquo;s men when they entered it. Then
Elis o&rsquo;r Nant&rsquo;s story represents it shutting after them,
and only opening to the shepherd in consequence of his having trodden
on a particular sod or spot. He then slid down unintentionally and
touched the bell that was hanging there, so that it rang and instantly
woke the sleeping warriors. No sooner had that happened than those men
of Arthur&rsquo;s took up their guns&mdash;never mind the
anachronism&mdash;and the shepherd made his way out more dead than
alive; and the frightened fellow never recovered from the shock to the
day of his death. When these warriors take up their guns they fire
away, we are told, without mercy from where each man stands: they are
not to advance a single step till Arthur comes to call them back to the
world.</p>
<p>To swell the irrelevancies under which this chapter labours already,
and to avoid severing cognate questions too rudely, I wish to add that
Elis o&rsquo;r Nant makes the name of the giant buried on the top of
Snowdon into Rhitta or Rhita instead of Ricca. That is also the form of
the name with which Mrs. Rhys was familiar throughout <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb478" href="#v2pb478" name=
"v2pb478">478</a>]</span>her childhood on the &#7930;anberis side of
the mountain. She often heard of Rhita<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e15382src" href="#xd26e15382" name="xd26e15382src">13</a> Gawr
having been buried on the top of Snowdon, and of other warriors on
other parts of Snowdon such as Moel Gynghorion and the Gist on that
<i>moel</i>. But Elis o&rsquo;r Nant goes further, and adds that from
Rhita the mountain was called <i>Wy&#273;fa Rhita</i>, more correctly
<i lang="cy">Gwy&#273;fa Rita</i>, &lsquo;Rhita&rsquo;s
Gwy&#273;fa.&rsquo; Fearing this might be merely an inference, I have
tried to cross-examine him so far as that is possible by letter. He
replies that his father was bred and born in the little glen called
Ewybrnant<a class="noteref" id="xd26e15417src" href="#xd26e15417" name=
"xd26e15417src">14</a>, between Bettws y Coed and Pen Machno, and that
his grandfather also lived there, where he appears to have owned land
not far from the home of the celebrated Bishop Morgan. Now Elis&rsquo;
father often talked, he says, in his hearing of &lsquo;Gwy&#273;fa
Rhita.&rsquo; Wishing to have some more definite evidence, I wrote
again, and he informs me that his father was very fond of talking about
<i>his</i> father, Elis o&rsquo;r Nant&rsquo;s grandfather, who appears
to have been a character and a great supporter of Sir Robert Williams,
especially in a keenly contested political election in 1796, when the
latter was opposed by the then head of the Penrhyn family. Sometimes
the old man from Ewybrnant would set out in his <i lang="cy">clocs</i>,
&lsquo;clogs or wooden shoes,&rsquo; to visit Sir Robert Williams, who
lived at Plas y Nant, near Be&#273;gelert. On starting he would say to
his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb479" href="#v2pb479" name=
"v2pb479">479</a>]</span>family, <i lang="cy">Mi a&rsquo;i hyibio troed
Gwy&#273;fa Rhita ag mi &#273;o&rsquo;n ol rwbrud cin nos</i>, or
sometimes <i lang="cy">foru</i>. That is, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go round
the foot of Rhita&rsquo;s <i lang="cy">Gwy&#273;fa</i> and come back
some time before night&rsquo;: sometimes he would say
&lsquo;to-morrow.&rsquo; Elis also states that his father used to
relate how Rhita&rsquo;s <i lang="cy">Gwy&#273;fa</i> was built, namely
by the simple process of each of his soldiers taking a stone to place
on Rhita&rsquo;s tomb. However the story as to Rhita Gawr being buried
on the top of Snowdon came into existence, there can be no doubt that
it was current in comparatively recent times, and that the Welsh name
of <i lang="cy">y Wy&#273;fa</i>, derived from it, refers to the
mountain as distinguished from the district in which it is situated. In
Welsh this latter is Eryri, the habitat, as it were, of the <i lang=
"cy">eryr</i>, &lsquo;eagle,&rsquo; a bird formerly at home there as
many local names go to prove, such as <i lang="cy">Carreg yr
Eryr</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e15468src" href="#xd26e15468" name=
"xd26e15468src">15</a>, &lsquo;the Stone of the Eagle,&rsquo; mentioned
in the boundaries of the lands on Snowdon granted to the Abbey of
Aberconwy in &#7930;ewelyn&rsquo;s charter, where also Snowdon mountain
is called <i lang="cy">Wedua vawr</i>, &lsquo;the Great
Gwy&#273;fa.&rsquo; Now, as already suggested, the word <i lang=
"cy">gwy&#273;fa</i> takes us back to Rhita&rsquo;s <i lang=
"cy">Carne&#273;</i> or Cairn, as it signified a monument, a tomb or
barrow: Dr. Davies gives it in his Welsh-Latin Dictionary as <i lang=
"la">Locus Sepultur&aelig;, Mausoleum</i>. This meaning of the word may
be illustrated by a reference in passing to the mention in <i lang=
"cy">Brut y Tywysogion</i> of the burial of Madog ab Maredy&#273;. For
under the year 1159 we are told that he was interred at Meifod, as it
was there his tomb or the vault of his family, the one intended also
for him (<i lang="cy">y &#7933;ydua</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e15509src" href="#xd26e15509" name="xd26e15509src">16</a>),
happened to be. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb480" href="#v2pb480"
name="v2pb480">480</a>]</span></p>
<p>Against the evidence just given, that tradition places Rhita&rsquo;s
grave on the top of Snowdon, a passing mention by Derfel Hughes (p. 52)
is of no avail, though to the effect that it is on the top of the
neighbouring mountain called <i lang="cy">Carne&#273; Lywelyn</i>,
&lsquo;&#7930;ewelyn&rsquo;s Cairn,&rsquo; that Rhita&rsquo;s Cairn was
raised. He deserves more attention, however, when he places <i lang=
"cy">Carne&#273; Drystan</i>, &lsquo;Tristan or Tristram&rsquo;s
Cairn,&rsquo; on a spur of that mountain, to wit, towards the east
above Ffynnon y &#7930;yffaint<a class="noteref" id="xd26e15527src"
href="#xd26e15527" name="xd26e15527src">17</a>. For it is worthy of
note that the name of Drystan, associated with Arthur in the later
romances, should figure with that of Arthur in the topography of the
same Snowdon district.</p>
<p>Before leaving Snowdon I may mention a cave near a small stream not
far from &#7930;yn Gwynain, about a mile and a half above Dinas Emrys.
In the &#7930;wyd letter (printed in the <i>Cambrian Journal</i> for
1859, pp. 142, 209), <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb481" href=
"#v2pb481" name="v2pb481">481</a>]</span>on which I have already drawn,
it is called <i lang="cy">Ogo&rsquo;r Gwr Blew</i>, &lsquo;the Hairy
Man&rsquo;s Cave&rsquo;; and the story relates how the Gwr Blew who
lived in it was fatally wounded by a woman who happened to be at home,
alone, in one of the nearest farm houses when the Gwr Blew came to
plunder it. Its sole interest here is that a later version<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e15624src" href="#xd26e15624" name=
"xd26e15624src">18</a> identifies the Hairy Man with Owen Lawgoch,
after modifying the former&rsquo;s designation <i lang="cy">y Gwr
Blew</i>, which literally meant &lsquo;the Hair Man,&rsquo; into
<i lang="cy">y Gwr Blewog</i>, &lsquo;the Hairy Man.&rsquo; This
doubtful instance of the presence of Owen Lawgoch in the folklore of
North Wales seems to stand alone.</p>
<p>Some of these cave stories, it will have been seen, reveal to us a
hero who is expected to return to interfere again in the affairs of
this world, and it is needless to say that Wales is by no means alone
in the enjoyment of imaginary prospects of this kind. The same sort of
poetic expectation has not been unknown, for instance, in Ireland. In
the summer of 1894, I spent some sunny days in the neighbourhood of the
Boyne, and one morning I resolved to see the chief burial mounds
dotting the banks of that interesting river; but before leaving the
hotel at Drogheda, my attention was attracted by a book of railway
advertisement of the kind which forcibly impels one to ask two
questions: why will not the railway companies leave those people alone
who do not want to travel, and why will they make it so tedious for
those who do? But on turning the leaves of that booklet over I was
inclined to a suaver mood, as I came on a paragraph devoted to an
ancient stronghold called the Grianan of Aileach, or Greenan-Ely, in
the highlands of Donegal. Here I read that a thousand armed men sit
resting there on their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb482" href=
"#v2pb482" name="v2pb482">482</a>]</span>swords, and bound by magic
sleep till they are to be called forth to take their part in the
struggle for the restoration of Erin&rsquo;s freedom. At intervals they
awake, it is said, and looking up from their trance they ask in tones
which solemnly resound through the many chambers of the Grianan:
&lsquo;Is the time come?&rsquo; A loud voice, that of the spiritual
caretaker, is heard to reply: &lsquo;The time is not yet.&rsquo; They
resume their former posture and sink into their sleep again. That is
the substance of the words I read, and they called to my mind the
legend of such heroes of the past as Barbarossa, with his sleep
interrupted only by his change of posture once in seven years; of Dom
Sebastian, for centuries expected from Moslem lands to restore the
glories of Portugal; of the Cid Rodrigo, expected back to do likewise
with the kingdom of Castile; and last, but not least, of the
O&rsquo;Donoghue who sleeps beneath the Lakes of Killarney, ready to
emerge to right the wrongs of Erin. With my head full of these and the
like dreams of folklore, I was taken over the scene of the Battle of
the Boyne; and the car-driver, having vainly tried to interest me in
it, gave me up in despair as an uncultured savage who felt no interest
in the history of Ireland. However he somewhat changed his mind when,
on reaching the first ancient burial mound, he saw me disappear
underground, fearless of the Fomhoraigh; and he began to wonder whether
I should ever return to pay him his fare. This in fact was the sheet
anchor of all my hopes; for I thought that in case I remained fast in a
narrow passage, or lost my way in the chambers of the prehistoric dead,
the jarvey must fetch me out again. So by the time I had visited three
of these ancient places, Dowth, Knowth, and New Grange, I had risen
considerably in his opinion; and he bethought him of stories older than
the Battle of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb483" href="#v2pb483"
name="v2pb483">483</a>]</span>the Boyne. So he told me on the way back
several bits of something less drearily historical. Among other things,
he pointed in the direction of a place called Ardee in the county of
Louth, where, he said, there is Garry Geerlaug&rsquo;s enchanted fort
full of warriors in magic sleep, with Garry Geerlaug himself in their
midst. Once on a time a herdsman is said to have strayed into their
hall, he said, and to have found the sleepers each with his sword and
his spear ready to hand. But as the intruder could not keep his hands
off the metal wealth of the place, the owners of the spears began to
rouse themselves, and the intruder had to flee for his life. But there
that armed host is awaiting the eventful call to arms, when they are to
sally forth to restore prosperity and glory to Ireland. That was his
story, and I became all attention as soon as I heard of Ardee, which is
in Irish <i lang="ga">&Aacute;th Fhir-dheadh</i>, or the Ford of
Fer-deadh, so called from Fer-deadh, who fought a protracted duel with
C&uacute;chulainn in that ford, where at the end, according to a
well-known Irish story, he fell by C&uacute;chulainn&rsquo;s hand. I
was still more exercised by the name of Garry Geerlaug, as I recognized
in Garry an Anglo-Irish pronunciation of the Norse name Godhfreydhr,
later Godhroedh, sometimes rendered Godfrey and sometimes Godred, while
in Man and in Scotland it has become Gorry, which may be heard also in
Ireland. I thought, further, that I recognized the latter part of Garry
Geerlaug&rsquo;s designation as the Norse female name Geirlaug. There
was no complete lack of Garries in that part of Ireland in the tenth
and eleventh centuries; but I have not yet found any historian to
identify for me the warrior named or nicknamed Garry Geerlaug, who is
to return blinking to this world of ours when his nap is over. Leaving
Ireland, I was told the other day of a place called Tom na Hurich, near
Inverness, where <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb484" href="#v2pb484"
name="v2pb484">484</a>]</span>Finn and his following are resting, each
on his left elbow, enjoying a broken sleep while waiting for the note
to be sounded, which is to call them forth. What they are then to do I
have not been told: it may be that they will proceed at once to solve
the Crofter Question, for there will doubtless be one.</p>
<p>It appears, to come back to Wales, that King Cadwaladr, who waged an
unsuccessful war with the Angles of Northumbria in the seventh century,
was long after his death expected to return to restore the Brythons to
power. At any rate so one is led in some sort of a hazy fashion to
believe in reading several of the poems in the manuscript known as the
<i>Book of Taliessin</i>. One finds, however, no trace of Cadwaladr in
our cave legends: the heroes of them are Arthur and Owen Lawgoch. Now
concerning Arthur one need at this point hardly speak, except to say
that the Welsh belief in the eventual return of Arthur was at one time
a powerful motive affecting the behaviour of the people of Wales, as
was felt, for instance, by English statesmen in the reign of Henry II.
But by our time the expected return of Arthur&mdash;<i lang="la">rexque
futurus</i>&mdash;has dissipated itself into a commonplace of folklore
fitted only to point an allegory, as when Elvet Lewis, one of the
sweetest of living Welsh poets, sings in a poem entitled <i lang=
"cy">Arthur gyda ni</i>, &lsquo;Arthur with us&rsquo;:&mdash;</p>

<p class="first">Not so with regard to the hopes associated with the
name of Owen Lawgoch; for we have it on Gwyniony&#273;&rsquo;s
testimony, p. 464, that our old <i lang="cy">baledwyr</i> or ballad men
used to sing about him at Welsh fairs: it is not in the least
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb485" href="#v2pb485" name=
"v2pb485">485</a>]</span>improbable that they still do so here and
there, unless the horrors of the ghastly murder last reported in the
newspapers have been found to pay better. At any rate Mr. Fisher (p.
379) has known old people in his native district in the &#7930;ychwr
Valley who could repeat stanzas or couplets from the ballads in
question. He traces these scraps to a booklet entitled
<i>Merlin&rsquo;s Prophecy<a class="noteref" id="xd26e15711src" href=
"#xd26e15711" name="xd26e15711src">19</a>, together with a brief
history of his life, taken from the Book of Prognostication</i>. This
little book bears no date, but appears to have been published in the
early part of the nineteenth century. It is partly in prose, dealing
briefly with the history of Merlin the Wild or Silvaticus, and the rest
consists of two poems. The first of these poems is entitled <i lang=
"cy">Dechreu Darogan Myr&#273;in</i>, &lsquo;the Beginning of
Merlin&rsquo;s Prognostication,&rsquo; and is made up of forty-nine
verses, several of which speak of Owen as king conquering all his foes
and driving out the Saxons: then in the forty-seventh stanza comes the
couplet which says, that this Owen is Henry the Ninth, who is tarrying
in a foreign land. The other poem is of a more general character, and
is entitled the Second Song of Merlin&rsquo;s Prognostication,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb486" href="#v2pb486" name=
"v2pb486">486</a>]</span>and consists of twenty-six stanzas of four
lines each like the previous one; but the third stanza describes
Arthur&rsquo;s bell at Caer&#7931;eon, &lsquo;Caerleon,&rsquo; ringing
with great vigour to herald the coming of Owen; and the seventh stanza
begins with the following couplet:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>Ceir gweled Owen Law-goch yn d&rsquo;od i Frydain

<p class="line"><i>Ceir gweled newyn ceiniog yn nhref

<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Owen Lawgoch one shall to Britain coming see,</p>
<p class="line">And dearth of pennies find at Chester on the Dee.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">It closes with the date in verse at the end, to wit,
1668, which takes us back to very troublous times: 1668 was the year of
the Triple Alliance of England, Sweden, and Holland against Louis XIV;
and it was not long after the Plague had raged, and London had had its
Great Fire. So it is a matter of no great surprise if some people in
Wales had a notion that the power of England was fast nearing its end,
and that the <i lang="cy">baledwyr</i> thought it opportune to
refurbish and adapt some of Merlin&rsquo;s prophecies as likely to be
acceptable to the peasantry of South Wales. At all events we have no
reason to suppose that the two poems which have here been described
from Mr. Fisher&rsquo;s data represented either the gentry of Wales,
whose ordinary speech was probably for the most part English, or the
bardic fraternity, who would have looked with contempt at the language
and style of the Prognostication. For, apart from careless printing,
this kind of literature can lay no claim to merit in point of diction
or of metre. Such productions represent probably the <i lang=
"cy">baledwyr</i> and the simple country people, such as still listen
in rapt attention to them doing at Welsh fairs and markets what they
are pleased to regard as singing. All this fits in well enough with the
folklore of the caves, such as the foregoing stories represent it. Here
I may add that I am informed by Mr. Craigfryn Hughes of a tradition
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb487" href="#v2pb487" name=
"v2pb487">487</a>]</span>that Arthur and his men are biding their time
near Caerleon on the Usk, to wit, in a cave resembling generally those
described in the foregoing legends. He also mentions a tradition as to
Owen Glyndwr&mdash;so he calls him, though it is unmistakably the Owen
of the <i lang="cy">baledwyr</i> who have been referred to by Mr.
Fisher&mdash;that he and his men are similarly slumbering in a cave in
Craig Gwrtheyrn, in Carmarthenshire. That is a spot in the
neighbourhood of &#7930;andyssil, consisting of an elevated field
terminating on one side in a sharp declivity, with the foot of the rock
laved by the stream of the Teifi. <i lang="cy">Craig Gwrtheyrn</i>
means Vortigern&rsquo;s Rock, and it is one of the sites with which
legend associates the name of that disreputable old king. I am not
aware that it shows any traces of ancient works, but it looks at a
distance an ideal site for an old fortification. An earlier prophecy
about Owen Lawgoch than any of these occurs, as kindly pointed out to
me by Mr. Gwenogvryn Evans, in the Peniarth MS. 94 (= Hengwrt MS. 412,
p. 23), and points back possibly to the last quarter of the fourteenth
century. See also one quoted by him, from the Mostyn MS. 133, in his
<i>Report on MSS. in the Welsh Language</i>, i. 106. Probably many more
such prophecies might be discovered if anybody undertook to make a
systematic search for them.</p>
<p>But who was Owen Lawgoch, if there ever was such a man? Such a man
there was undoubtedly; for we read in one of the documents printed in
the miscellaneous volume commonly known as the <i>Record of
Carnarvon</i>, that at a court held at Conway in the forty-fourth year
of Edward III a certain Gruffy&#273; Says was adjudged to forfeit all
the lands which he held in Anglesey to the Prince of Wales&mdash;who
was at that time no other than Edward the Black Prince&mdash;for the
reason <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb488" href="#v2pb488" name=
"v2pb488">488</a>]</span>that the said Gruffy&#273; had been an
adherent of Owen: <i lang="la">adherens fuisset Owino Lawegogh</i> (or
<i lang="cy">Lawgogh</i>) <i lang="la">inimico et proditori predicti
domini Principis et de consilio predicti Owyni ad mouendam guerram in
Wallia contra predictum dominum Principem</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e15779src" href="#xd26e15779" name="xd26e15779src">20</a>. How
long previously it had been attempted to begin a war on behalf of this
Owen Lawgoch one cannot say, but it so happens that at this time there
was a captain called <i>Yeuwains</i>, <i>Yewains</i>, or <i>Yvain de
Gales</i> or <i>Galles</i>, &lsquo;Owen of Wales,&rsquo; fighting on
the French side against the English in Edward&rsquo;s Continental wars.
Froissart in his <i>Chronicles</i> has a great deal to say of him, for
he distinguished himself greatly on various critical occasions. From
the historian&rsquo;s narrative one finds that Owen had escaped when a
boy to the court of Philip VI of France, who received him with great
favour and had him educated with his own nephews. Froissart&rsquo;s
account of him is, that the king of England, Edward III, had slain his
father and given his lordship and principality to his own son as Prince
of Wales; and Froissart gives Owen&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s name as
<i>Aymon</i>, which should mean <i>Edmond</i>, unless the name intended
may have been rather <i>Einion</i>. However that may have been, Owen
was engaged in the Battle of Poitiers in 1356, and when peace was made
he went to serve in Lombardy; but when war between England and France
broke out again in 1369, he returned to France. He sometimes fought on
sea and sometimes on land, but he was always entrusted by the French
king, who was now Charles V, with important commands<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e15816src" href="#xd26e15816" name="xd26e15816src">21</a>. Thus
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb489" href="#v2pb489" name=
"v2pb489">489</a>]</span>in 1372 he was placed at the head of a
flotilla with 3,000 men, and ordered to operate against the English: he
made a descent on the Isle of Guernsey<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e15823src" href="#xd26e15823" name="xd26e15823src">22</a>, and
while there besieging the castle of Cornet, he was charged by the king
of France to sail to Spain to invite the king of Castile to send his
fleet again to help in the attack on La Rochelle. Whilst staying at
Santander the earl of Pembroke was brought thither, having been taken
prisoner in the course of the destruction of the English fleet before
La Rochelle. Owen, on seeing the earl of Pembroke, asks him with
bitterness if he is come there to do him homage for his land, of which
he had taken possession in Wales. He threatens to avenge himself on him
as soon as he can, and also on the earl of Hereford and Edward Spencer,
for it was by the fathers of these three men, he said, his own father
had been betrayed to death. Edward III died in 1377, and the Black
Prince had died shortly before. Owen survived them both, and was
actively engaged in the siege of Mortagne sur Mer in Poitou, when he
was assassinated by one Lamb, who had insinuated himself into his
service and confidence, partly by pretending to bring <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb490" href="#v2pb490" name=
"v2pb490">490</a>]</span>him news about his native land and telling him
that all Wales was longing to have him back to be the lord of his
country&mdash;<i lang="fr">et lui fist acroire que toute li terre de
Gales le desiroient mout &agrave; ravoir &agrave; seigneur</i>. So Owen
fell in the year 1378, and was buried at the church of
Saint-L&eacute;ger<a class="noteref" id="xd26e15863src" href=
"#xd26e15863" name="xd26e15863src">23</a> while Lamb returned to the
English to receive his stipulated pay. When this happened Owen&rsquo;s
namesake, Owen Glyndwr, was nearly thirty years of age. The latter was
eventually to assert with varying fortune on several fields of battle
in this country the claims of his elder kinsman, who, by virtue of his
memory in France, would seem to have rendered it easy for the later
Owen to enter into friendly relations with the French court of his
day<a class="noteref" id="xd26e15888src" href="#xd26e15888" name=
"xd26e15888src">24</a>.</p>
<p>Now as to Yvain de Galles, the Rev. Thomas Price (Carnhuanawc) in
his <i>Hanes Cymru</i>, &lsquo;History of Wales,&rsquo; devotes a
couple of pages, 735&ndash;7, to Froissart&rsquo;s account of him, and
he points out that Angharad &#7930;wyd, in her edition of Sir John
Wynne&rsquo;s <i>History of the Gwydir Family</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e15901src" href="#xd26e15901" name="xd26e15901src">25</a>, had
found Owen Lawgoch to have been Owen <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb491" href="#v2pb491" name="v2pb491">491</a>]</span>ab Thomas ab
Rhodri, brother to &#7930;ewelyn, the last native prince of Wales. One
of the names, however, among other things, forms a difficulty: why did
Froissart call Yvain&rsquo;s father Aymon? So it is clear that a more
searching study of Welsh pedigrees and other documents, including those
at the Record Office<a class="noteref" id="xd26e15914src" href=
"#xd26e15914" name="xd26e15914src">26</a>, has to be made before Owen
can be satisfactorily placed in point of succession. For that he was in
the right line to succeed the native princes of Wales is suggested both
by the eagerness with which all Wales was represented as looking to his
return to be the lord of the country, and by the opening words of
Froissart in describing what he had been robbed of by Edward III, as
being both lordship and principality&mdash;<i lang="fr">la signourie et
princet&eacute;</i>. Be that as it may, there is, it seems to me,
little doubt that Yvain de Galles was no other than the Owen Lawgoch,
whose adherent Gruffy&#273; Says was deprived of his land and property
in the latter part of Edward&rsquo;s reign. In the next place, there is
hardly room for doubt that the Owen Lawgoch here referred to was the
same man whom the <i>baledwyr</i> in their jumble of prophecies
intended to be Henry the Ninth, that is to say the Welsh successor to
the last Tudor king, Henry VIII, and that he was at the same time the
hero of the cave legends of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb492"
href="#v2pb492" name="v2pb492">492</a>]</span>divers parts of the
Principality, especially South Wales, as already indicated.</p>
<p>Now without being able to say why Owen and his analogues should
become the heroes of cave legends contemplating a second advent, it is
easy to point to circumstances which facilitated their doing so. It is
useless to try to discuss the question of Arthur&rsquo;s disappearance;
but take Garry Geerlaug, for instance, a roving Norseman, as we may
suppose from his name, who may have suddenly disappeared with his
followers, never more to be heard of in the east of Ireland. In the
absence of certain news of his death, it was all the easier to imagine
that he was dozing quietly away in an enchanted fortress. Then as to
King Cadwaladr, who was also, perhaps, to have returned to this world,
so little is known concerning his end that historians have no certainty
to this day when or where he died. So much the readier therefore would
the story gain currency that he was somewhere biding his time to come
back to retrieve his lost fortunes. Lastly, there is Owen Lawgoch, the
magic of whose name has only been dissipated in our own day: he died in
France in the course of a protracted war with the kings of England. It
is not likely, then, that the peasantry of Wales could have heard
anything definite about his fate. So here also the circumstances were
favourable to the cave legend and the dream that he was, whether at
home or abroad, only biding his time. Moreover, in all these cases the
hope-inspiring delusion gained currency among a discontented people,
probably, who felt the sore need of a deliverer to save them from
oppression or other grievous hardships of their destiny.</p>
<p>The question can no longer be prevented from presenting itself as to
the origin of this idea of a second advent of a hero of the past; but
in that form it is too <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb493" href=
"#v2pb493" name="v2pb493">493</a>]</span>large for discussion here, and
it would involve a review, for instance, of one of the cardinal beliefs
of the Latter-day Saints as to the coming of Christ to reign on earth,
and other doctrines supposed to be derived from the New Testament. On
the other hand, there is no logical necessity why the expected
deliverer should have been in the world before: witness the Jews, who
are looking forward not to the return but to the birth and first coming
of their Messiah. So the question here may be confined more or less
strictly to its cave-legend form; and though I cannot answer it, some
advance in the direction whence the answer should come may perhaps be
made. In the first place, one will have noticed that Arthur and Owen
Lawgoch come more or less in one another&rsquo;s way; and the
presumption is that Owen Lawgoch has been to a certain extent ousting
Arthur, who may be regarded as having the prior claim, not to mention
that in the case of the Gwr Blew cave, p. 481, Owen is made by an
apparently recent version of the story to evict from his lair a
commonplace robber of no special interest. In other words, the Owen
Lawgoch legend is, so to say, detected spreading itself<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e15935src" href="#xd26e15935" name=
"xd26e15935src">27</a>. That is very possibly just what had happened at
a remoter period in the case of the Arthur legend itself. In other
words, Arthur has taken the place of some ancient divinity, such as
that dimly brought within our ken by Plutarch in the words placed at
the head of this chapter. He reproduces the report of a certain
Demetrius, sent by the emperor of Rome to reconnoitre and inspect the
coasts of Britain. It was to the effect that around <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb494" href="#v2pb494" name=
"v2pb494">494</a>]</span>Britain lay many uninhabited islands, some of
which are named after deities and some after heroes; and of the islands
inhabited, he visited the one nearest to the uninhabited ones. Of this
the dwellers were few, but the people of Britain treated them as
sacrosanct and inviolable in their persons. Among other things, they
related to him how terrible storms, diseases, and portents happened on
the occasion of any one of the mighty leaving this life. He
adds:&mdash;&lsquo;Moreover there is, they said, an island in which
Cronus is imprisoned, with Briareus keeping guard over him as he
sleeps; for, as they put it, sleep is the bond forged for Cronus. They
add that around him are many divinities, his henchmen and
attendants<a class="noteref" id="xd26e15949src" href="#xd26e15949"
name="xd26e15949src">28</a>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>What divinity, Celtic or pre-Celtic, this may have been who recalled
Cronus or Saturn to the mind of the Roman officer, it is impossible to
say. It is to be noticed that he sleeps and that his henchmen are with
him, but no allusion is made to treasure. No more is there, however, in
Mr. Fisher&rsquo;s version of the story of Ogo&rsquo;r &#272;inas,
which, according to him, says that Arthur and his warriors there lie
sleeping with their right hands clasping the hilts of their drawn
swords, ready to encounter any one who may venture to disturb their
repose. On the other hand, legends about cave treasure are probably
very ancient, and in some at least of our stories the safe keeping of
such treasure must be regarded as the original object of the presence
of the armed host.</p>
<p>The permission supposed to be allowed an intruder to take away a
reasonable quantity of the cave gold, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb495" href="#v2pb495" name="v2pb495">495</a>]</span>I should look
at in the light of a sort of protest on the part of the story-teller
against the niggardliness of the cave powers. I cannot help suspecting
in the same way that the presence of a host of armed warriors to guard
some piles of gold and silver for unnumbered ages must have struck the
fancy of the story-tellers as disproportionate, and that this began
long ago to cause a modification in the form of the legends. That is to
say, the treasure sank into a mere accessory of the presence of the
armed men, who are not guarding any such thing so much as waiting for
the destined hour when they are to sally forth to make lost causes win.
Originally the armed warriors were in some instances presumably the
henchmen of a sleeping divinity, as in the story told to Demetrius; but
perhaps oftener they were the guardians of treasure, just as much as
the invisible agencies are, which bring on thunder and lightning and
portents when any one begins to dig at Dinas Emrys or other spots where
ancient treasure lies hidden. There is, it must be admitted, no
objection to regarding the attendants of a divinity as at the same time
the guardians of his treasure. In none, however, of these cave stories
probably may we suppose the principal figure to have originally been
that of the hero expected to return among men: he, when found in them,
is presumably to be regarded as a comparatively late interloper. But it
is, as already hinted, not to be understood that the notion of a
returning hero is itself a late one. Quite the contrary; and the
question then to be answered is, Where was that kind of hero supposed
to pass his time till his return? There is only one answer to which
Welsh folklore points, and that is, In fairyland. This is also the
teaching of the ancient legend about Arthur, who goes away to the Isle
of Avallon to be healed of his wounds by the fairy <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb496" href="#v2pb496" name=
"v2pb496">496</a>]</span>maiden Morgen; and, according to an anonymous
poet<a class="noteref" id="xd26e15969src" href="#xd26e15969" name=
"xd26e15969src">29</a>, it is in her charms that one should look for
the reason why Arthur tarries so long:&mdash;</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="first">Here may be cited by way of comparison Walter
Mapes&rsquo; statement as to the Trinio, concerning whom he was quoted
in the first chapter, p. 72 above. He says, that as Trinio was never
seen after the losing battle, in which he and his friends had engaged
with a neighbouring chieftain, it was believed in the district around
&#7930;yn Syfa&#273;on, that Trinio&rsquo;s fairy mother had rescued
him from the enemy and taken him away with her to her home in the lake.
In the case of Arthur it is, as we have seen, a fairy also or a lake
lady that intervenes; and there cannot be much room for doubt, that the
story representing him going to fairyland to be healed is far older
than any which pictures him sleeping in a cave with his warriors and
his gold all around him. As for the gold, however, it is abundantly
represented as nowhere more common than in the home of the fairies: so
this metal treated as a test cannot greatly help us in essaying the
distinction here suggested. With regard to Owen Lawgoch, however, one
is not forced to suppose that he was ever believed to have sojourned in
Faery: the legendary precedent of Arthur as a cave sleeper would
probably suffice to open the door for him to enter the recesses of
Craig y &#272;inas, as soon as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb497"
href="#v2pb497" name="v2pb497">497</a>]</span>the country folk began to
grow weary of waiting for his return. In other words, most of our cave
legends have combined together two sets of popular belief originally
distinct, the one referring to a hero gone to the world of the fairies
and expected some day to return, and the other to a hero or god
enjoying an enchanted sleep with his retinue all around him. In some of
our legends, however, such as that of &#7930;anciau Eryri, the process
of combining the two sets of story has been left to this day
incomplete. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb498" href="#v2pb498"

<i>Elisse</i>. This in time lost its identity by assimilation with the
English name <i>Ellis</i>. Thus, for example, in Wynne&rsquo;s edition
of Powell&rsquo;s Caradog of &#7930;ancarfan&rsquo;s <i>History of
Wales</i> (London, 1774), pp. 22, 24, <i>Elised</i> is reduced to

instance of which see Duffus Hardy&rsquo;s <i>Descriptive

more than balanced by <i>Rita</i> in the <i>Book of &#7930;an

diocese of &#7930;andaff; see pp. 32, 43, 90, 272. The uncertainty is
confined to the spelling, and it has arisen from the difficulty of
deciding in medieval manuscripts between <i>t</i> and <i>c</i>: there

Derfel Hughes&rsquo; <i lang="cy">&#7930;andegai and
&#7930;an&#7931;echid</i>, p. 53. As to Drystan it is the Pictish name
<i>Drostan</i>, but a kindred form occurs in Cornwall on a stone near
Fowey, where years ago I guessed the ancient genitive <i>Drustagni</i>;
and after examining it recently I am able to confirm my original guess.
The name of Drystan recalls that of Essy&#7931;t, which offers some
difficulty. It first occurs in Welsh in the Nennian Genealogies in the
Harleian MS. 3859: see Pedigree I in the <i>Cymmrodor</i>, ix. 169,
where we read that Mermin (Merfyn) was son of Etthil daughter of Cinnan
(Cynan), who succeeded his father Rhodri Molwynog in the sovereignty of
Gwyne&#273; in 754. The spelling <i>Etthil</i> is to be regarded like
that of the Welsh names in Nennius, for some instances of which see
&sect; 73 (quoted in the next chapter) and the Old Welsh words
<i>calaur</i>, <i>nouel</i>, <i>patel</i>, so spelt in the Juvencus
Codex: see Skene, ii. 2: in all these <i>l</i> does duty for
<i>&#7931;</i>. So <i>Etthil</i> is to be treated as pronounced
Ethi&#7931; or Ethy&#7931;; but Jesus College MS. 20 gives a more
ancient pronunciation (at least as regards the consonants) when it
calls Cynan&rsquo;s daughter <i>Ethe&#7931;t</i>: see the
<i>Cymmrodor</i>, viii. 87. Powell, in his <i>History of Wales</i> by
Caradog of &#7930;ancarfan, as edited by Wynne, writes the name
<i>Esylht</i>; and the Medieval Welsh spelling has usually been
<i>Essy&#7931;t</i> or <i>Esy&#7931;t</i>, which agrees in its sibilant
with the French <i>Iselt</i> or <i>Iseut</i>; but who made the
Breton-looking change from <i>Eth</i> to <i>Es</i> or <i>Is</i> in this
name remains a somewhat doubtful point. Professor Zimmer, in the
<i lang="de">Zeitschrift f&uuml;r franz&ouml;sische Sprache und
Litteratur</i>, xiii. 73&ndash;5, points out that the name is an
Anglo-Saxon <i>Ethylda</i> borrowed, which he treats as a
&lsquo;<span lang="de">Kurzform f&uuml;r
<i>Ethelhild</i></span>&rsquo;: see also the <i lang="fr">Revue
Celtique</i>, xii. 397, xiii. 495. The adoption of this name in Wales
may be regarded as proof of intermarriage or alliance between an
English family and the royal house of Gwyne&#273; as early as the
eighth century.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

have never seen a copy, but Mr. Fisher gives me the title as follows:
<i lang="cy">Prophwydoliaeth Myr&#273;in Wy&#7931;t yn nghyda ber Hanes
o&rsquo;i Fywyd, wedi eu tynu a&#7931;an o Lyfr y Daroganau &hellip;
Caerfyr&#273;in &hellip; Pris dwy Geiniog</i>. It has no date, but Mr.
Fisher once had a copy with the date 1847. Recently he has come across
another versified prophecy written in the same style as the printed
ones, and referring to an Owain who may have been Owen Lawgoch. The
personage meant is compared to the most brilliant of pearls, <i lang=
"cy">Owain glain golyaf</i>. The prophecy is to be found at the Swansea
Public Library, and occurs in a seventeenth century manuscript manual
of Roman Catholic Devotion, Latin and Welsh. It gives 1440 as the year
of the deliverance of the <i>Brytaniaid</i>. It forms the first of two
poems (fo. 37), the second of which is ascribed to Taliessin. Such is
Mr. Fisher&rsquo;s account of it, and the lines which he has copied for
me cling to the same theme of the ultimate triumph of the Kymry. Quite
recently I have received further information as to these prophecies
from Mr. J. H. Davies, of Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn (p. 354), who will, it is
to be hoped, soon publish the results of his intimate study of their
history in South Wales.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

to the original destination of the flotilla, see Kervyn de
Lettenhove&rsquo;s edition of Froissart (Brussels, 1870&ndash;7), viii.
435&ndash;7, where the editor has brought together several notes, from
which it appears that Owen tried unsuccessfully to recruit an army in
Spain, but that he readily got together in France a considerable force.
For Charles V, on May 8, 1372, ordered the formation of an army, to be
placed under Owen&rsquo;s command for the reconquest of his
ancestors&rsquo; lands in Wales, and two days later Owen issued a
declaration as to his Welsh claims and his obligations to the French
king; but the flotilla stopped short with Guernsey. It is not
improbable, however, that the fear in England of a descent on Wales by
Owen began at least as early as 1369. In his declaration Owen calls
himself <i>Evain de Gales</i>, which approaches the Welsh spelling
<i>Ewein</i>, more frequently <i>Ywein</i>, modern <i>Ywain</i>, except
that all these forms tended to be supplanted by <i>Owain</i> or
<i>Owen</i>. This last is, strictly speaking, the colloquial form, just
as <i>Howel</i> is the colloquial form of <i>Hywel</i>, and
<i>bowyd</i> of <i>bywyd</i>, &lsquo;life.&rsquo;&nbsp;<a class=

given of his life and a complete account of his death. In Lord
Berners&rsquo; translation, published in Henry VIII&rsquo;s time, Owen
is called Yuan of Wales, as if anybody could even glance at the
romances without finding that <i>Owen ab Urien</i>, for instance,
became in French <i>Ywains</i> or <i lang="fr">Ivains le fils Urien</i>
in the nominative, and <i>Ywain</i> or <i>Ivain</i> in r&eacute;gime.
Thomas Johnes of Hafod, whose translation was published in

has already been undertaken: on Feb. 7, 1900, a summary of this chapter
was read to a meeting of the Hon. Society of Cymmrodorion, and six
weeks later Mr. Edward Owen, of Gray&rsquo;s Inn, read an elaborate
paper in which he essayed to fix more exactly Yvain de Galles&rsquo;
place in the history of Wales. It would be impossible here to do
justice to his reasoning, based as it was on a careful study of the
records in point. Let it suffice for the present, however, that the
paper will in due course appear in the Society&rsquo;s
<i>Transactions</i>. Mr. J. H. Davies also informs me that he is
bringing together items of evidence, which tend, as he thinks, to show
that Miss &#7930;wyd&rsquo;s information was practically correct.
Before, however, the question can be considered satisfactorily
answered, some explanation will have to be offered of Froissart&rsquo;s

<p>i. 30<sup>a</sup>:&mdash;Drystan<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e16065src" href="#xd26e16065" name="xd26e16065src">2</a> son of
Ta&#7931;wch who guarded the swine of March son of Meirchion while the
swineherd went to bid Essy&#7931;t come to meet him: at the same time
Arthur sought to have one sow by fraud or force, and failed.</p>
<p>ii. 56<sup>b</sup>:&mdash;Drystan son of Ta&#7931;wch with the swine
of March ab Meirchion while the swineherd went on a message to
Essy&#7931;t. Arthur and March and Cai and Bedwyr came all four to him,
but obtained from Drystan not even as much as a single porker, whether
by force, by fraud, or by theft.</p>
<p>iii. 101<sup>c</sup>:&mdash;The third was Trystan son of
Ta&#7931;wch, who guarded the swine of March son of Meirchion while the
swineherd had gone on a message to Essy&#7931;t to bid her appoint a
meeting with Trystan. Now Arthur and Marche&#7931; and Cai and Bedwyr
undertook to go and make an attempt on him, but they proved unable to
get possession of as much as one porker either as a gift or as a
purchase, whether by fraud, by force, or by theft.</p>
<p>In this story the well-known love of Drystan and Essy&#7931;t is
taken for granted; but the whole setting is so peculiar and so unlike
that of the story of Tristan and Iselt or Iseut in the romances, that
there is no reason to suppose it in any way derived from the
latter.</p>
<p>The next portion of the Triad runs thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>1 30<sup>b</sup>:&mdash;And Pryderi son of Pwy&#7931; of Annwvyn who
guarded the swine of Pendaran of Dyfed in the Glen of the Cuch in
Emlyn.</p>
<p>ii. 56<sup>a</sup>:&mdash;Pryderi son of Pwy&#7931; Head of Annwn
with the swine of Pendaran of Dyfed his foster father. The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb500" href="#v2pb500" name=
"v2pb500">500</a>]</span>swine were the seven brought away by
Pwy&#7931; Head of Annwn and given by him to Pendaran of Dyfed his
foster father; and the Glen of the Cuch was the place where they were
kept. The reason why Pryderi is called a mighty swineherd is that no
one could prevail over him either by fraud or by force<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e16097src" href="#xd26e16097" name=
"xd26e16097src">3</a>.</p>
<p>iii. 101<sup>a</sup>:&mdash;The first was Pryderi son of Pwy&#7931;
of Pendaran in Dyfed<a class="noteref" id="xd26e16118src" href=
"#xd26e16118" name="xd26e16118src">4</a>, who guarded his
father&rsquo;s swine while he was in Annwn, and it was in the Glen of
the Cuch that he guarded them.</p>
<p>The history of the pigs is given, so to say, in the
<i>Mabinogion</i>. Pwy&#7931; had been able to strike up a friendship
and even an alliance with Arawn king of Annwvyn<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e16126src" href="#xd26e16126" name="xd26e16126src">5</a> or Annwn,
which now means Hades or the other world; and they kept up their
friendship partly by exchanging presents of horses, greyhounds,
falcons, and any other things calculated to give gratification to the
receiver of them. Among other gifts which Pryderi appears to have
received from the king of Annwn were <i>hobeu</i> or <i>moch</i>,
&lsquo;pigs, swine,&rsquo; which had never before been heard of in the
island of Prydain. The news about this new race of animals, and that
they formed sweeter food than oxen, was not long before it reached
Gwyne&#273;; and we shall presently see that there was another story
which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb501" href="#v2pb501" name=
"v2pb501">501</a>]</span>flatly contradicts this part of the Triad,
namely to the effect that Gwydion, nephew of Math king of Gwyne&#273;
and a great magician, came to Pryderi&rsquo;s court at Rhu&#273;lan,
near Dolau Bach or Highmead on the Teifi in what is now the county of
Cardigan, and obtained some of the swine by deceiving the king. But, to
pass by that for the present, I may say that Dyfed seems to have been
famous for rearing swine; and at the present day one affects to believe
in the neighbouring districts that the chief industry in Dyfed, more
especially in South Cardiganshire, consists in the rearing of parsons,
carpenters, and pigs. Perhaps it is also worth mentioning that the
people of the southern portion of Dyfed are nicknamed by the men of
Glamorgan to this day <i>Moch Sir Benfro</i>, &lsquo;the Pigs of
Pembrokeshire.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But why so much importance attached to pigs? I cannot well give a
better answer than the reader can himself supply if he will only
consider what r&ocirc;le the pig plays in the domestic economy of
modern Ireland. But, to judge from old Irish literature, it was even
more so in ancient times, as pigs&rsquo; meat was so highly
appreciated, that under some one or other of its various names it
usually takes its place at the head of all flesh meats in Irish
stories. This seems the case, for instance, in the medieval story
called the Vision of MacConglinne<a class="noteref" id="xd26e16168src"
href="#xd26e16168" name="xd26e16168src">6</a>; and, to go further back,
to the Feast of Bricriu for instance, one finds it decidedly the case
with the Champion&rsquo;s Portion<a class="noteref" id="xd26e16171src"
href="#xd26e16171" name="xd26e16171src">7</a> at that stormy banquet.
Then one may mention the story of the fatal feast on
Mac-D&aacute;th&oacute;&rsquo;s great swine<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e16180src" href="#xd26e16180" name="xd26e16180src">8</a>, where
that beast would have apparently sufficed for the braves both of
Connaught <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb502" href="#v2pb502" name=
"v2pb502">502</a>]</span>and Ulster had Conall Cernach carved fair, and
not given more than their share to his own Ultonian friends in order to
insult the Connaught men by leaving them nothing but the fore-legs. It
is right, however, to point out that most of the stories go to show,
that the gourmands of ancient Erin laid great stress on the pig being
properly fed, chiefly on milk and the best kind of meal. It cannot have
been very different in ancient Wales; for we read in the story of
Peredur that, when he sets out from his mother&rsquo;s home full of his
mother&rsquo;s counsel, he comes by-and-by to a pavilion, in front of
which he sees food, some of which he proceeds to take according to his
mother&rsquo;s advice, though the gorgeously dressed lady sitting near
it has not the politeness to anticipate his wish. It consisted, we are
told, of two bottles of wine, two loaves of white bread, and collops of
a milk-fed pig&rsquo;s flesh<a class="noteref" id="xd26e16185src" href=
"#xd26e16185" name="xd26e16185src">9</a>. The home of the fairies was
imagined to be a land of luxury and happiness with which nothing could
compare in this world. In this certain Welsh and Irish stories agree;
and in one of the latter, where the king of the fairies is trying to
persuade the queen of Ireland to elope with him, we find that among the
many inducements offered her are fresh pig, sweet milk, and
ale<a class="noteref" id="xd26e16217src" href="#xd26e16217" name=
"xd26e16217src">10</a>. Conversely, as the fairies were considered to
be always living and to be a very old-fashioned and ancient people,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb503" href="#v2pb503" name=
"v2pb503">503</a>]</span>it was but natural to suppose that they had
the animals which man found useful, such as horses, cattle, and sheep,
except that they were held to be of superior breeds, as they are
represented, for instance, in our lake legends. Similarly, it is
natural enough that other stories should ascribe to them also the
possession of herds of swine; and all this prior to man&rsquo;s having
any. The next step in the reasoning would be that man had obtained his
from the fairies. It is some tradition of this kind that possibly
suggested the line taken by the Pwy&#7931; story in the matter of the
derivation of the pig from Annwn: see the last chapter.</p>
<p>The next story in the Triad is, if possible, wilder still: it runs
as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>i. 30<sup>c</sup>:&mdash;Co&#7931; son of Co&#7931;frewi<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e16238src" href="#xd26e16238" name=
"xd26e16238src">11</a> who guarded Henwen<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e16246src" href="#xd26e16246" name="xd26e16246src">12</a>,
Da&#7931;weir Da&#7931;ben&rsquo;s sow, which went burrowing as far as
the Headland of Awstin in Kernyw and then took to the sea. It was at
Aber Torogi in Gwent Is-coed that she came to land, with Co&#7931;
keeping his grip on her bristles whatever way she went by sea or by
land. Now in Maes Gwenith, &lsquo;Wheat Field,&rsquo; in Gwent she
dropped a grain of wheat and a bee, and thenceforth that has been the
best place for wheat. Then she went as far as &#7930;onwen in Penfro
and there dropped a grain of barley and a bee, and thenceforth
&#7930;onwen has been the best place for barley. Then she proceeded to
Rhiw Gyferthwch in Eryri and dropped a wolf-cub and an eagle-chick.
These Co&#7931; gave away, the eagle to the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb504" href="#v2pb504" name=
"v2pb504">504</a>]</span>Goidel Brynach from the North, and the wolf to
Menwaed of Ar&#7931;echwe&#273;, and they came to be known as
Menwaed&rsquo;s Wolf and Brynach&rsquo;s Eagle. Then the sow went as
far as the Maen Du at &#7930;anfair in Arfon, and there she dropped a
kitten, and that kitten Co&#7931; cast into the Menai: that came later
to be known as Cath Paluc, &lsquo;Palug&rsquo;s Cat.&rsquo;</p>
<p>ii. 56<sup>c</sup>:&mdash;The third was Co&#7931; son of
Ka&#7931;ureuy with the swine of Da&#7931;wyr Da&#7931;ben in
Da&#7931;wyr&rsquo;s Glen in Kernyw. Now one of the swine was with
young and Henwen was her name; and it was foretold that the Isle of
Prydain would be the worse for her litter; and Arthur collected the
host of Prydain and went about to destroy it. Then one sow went
burrowing, and at the Headland of Hawstin in Kernyw she took to the sea
with the swineherd following her. And in Maes Gwenith in Gwent she
dropped a grain of wheat and a bee, and ever since Maes Gwenith is the
best place for wheat and bees. And at &#7930;onyon in Penfro she
dropped a grain of barley and another of wheat: therefore the barley of
&#7930;onyon has passed into a proverb. And on Rhiw Gyferthwch in Arfon
she dropped a wolf-cub and an eagle-chick. The wolf was given to
Mergaed and the eagle to Breat a prince from the North, and they were
the worse for having them. And at &#7930;anfair in Arfon, to wit below
the Maen Du, she dropped a kitten, and from the Maen Du the swineherd
cast it into the sea, but the sons of Paluc reared it to their
detriment. It grew to be Cath Paluc, &lsquo;Palug&rsquo;s Cat,&rsquo;
and proved one of the three chief molestations of Mona reared in the
island: the second was Daronwy and the third was Edwin king of
England.</p>
<p>iii. 101<sup>b</sup>:&mdash;The second was Co&#7931; son of
Co&#7931;frewi who guarded Da&#7931;waran Da&#7931;ben&rsquo;s sow,
that came burrowing as far as the Headland of Penwedic in Kernyw and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb505" href="#v2pb505" name=
"v2pb505">505</a>]</span>then took to the sea; and she came to land at
Aber Tarogi in Gwent Is-coed with Co&#7931; keeping his hold of her
bristles whithersoever she went on sea or land. At Maes Gwenith in
Gwent she dropped three grains of wheat and three bees, and ever since
Gwent has the best wheat and bees. From Gwent she proceeded to Dyfed
and dropped a grain of barley and a porker, and ever since Dyfed has
the best barley and pigs: it was in &#7930;onnio &#7930;onnwen these
were dropped. Afterwards she proceeded to Arfon (<i>sic</i>) and in
&#7930;eyn she dropped the grain of rye, and ever since &#7930;eyn and
Eifiony&#273; have the best rye. And on the side of Rhiw Gyferthwch she
dropped a wolf-cub and an eagle-chick. Co&#7931; gave the eagle to
Brynach the Goidel of Dinas Affaraon, and the wolf to Menwaed lord of
Ar&#7931;echwe&#273;, and one often hears of Brynach&rsquo;s Wolf and
Menwaed&rsquo;s Eagle [the writer was careless: he has made the owners
exchange pests]. Then she went as far as the Maen Du in Arfon, where
she dropped a kitten and Co&#7931; cast it into the Menai. That was the
Cath Balwg (<i>sic</i>), &lsquo;Palug&rsquo;s Cat&rsquo;: it proved a
molestation to the Isle of Mona subsequently.</p>
<p>Such are the versions we have of this story, and a few notes on the
names seem necessary before proceeding further. Co&#7931; is called
Co&#7931; son of Co&#7931;urewy in i. 30, and Co&#7931; son of
Ka&#7931;ureuy in ii. 56: all that is known of him comes from other
Triads, i. 32&ndash;3, ii. 20, and iii. 90. The first two tell us that
he was one of the Three chief Enchanters of the Isle of Prydain, and
that he was taught his magic by Rhu&#273;lwm the Giant; while ii. 20
calls the latter a dwarf and adds that Co&#7931; was nephew to him. The
matter is differently put in iii. 90, to the effect that Rhu&#273;lwm
the Giant learnt his magic from Ei&#273;[il]ig the Dwarf and from
Co&#7931; son of Co&#7931;frewi. Nothing is known of
Da&#7931;wyr&rsquo;s Glen in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb506"
href="#v2pb506" name="v2pb506">506</a>]</span>Kernyw, or of the person
after whom it was named. Kernyw is the Welsh for Cornwall, but if
Penryn Awstin or Hawstin is to be identified with Aust Cliff on the
Severn Sea in Gloucestershire, the story would seem to indicate a time
when Cornwall extended north-eastwards as far as that point. The later
Triad, iii. 101, avoids Penryn Awstin and substitutes Penwe&#273;ic,
which recalls some such a name as Pengwaed<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e16288src" href="#xd26e16288" name="xd26e16288src">13</a> or
Penwith in Cornwall: elsewhere Penwe&#273;ic<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e16297src" href="#xd26e16297" name="xd26e16297src">14</a> is only
given as the name of the most northern hundred of Keredigion. Gwent
Is-coed means Gwent below the Wood or Forest, and Aber Torogi or
Tarogi&mdash;omitted, probably by accident, in ii. 56&mdash;is now
Caldicot Pill, where the small river Tarogi, now called Troggy,
discharges itself not very far from Portskewet. Maes Gwenith in the
same neighbourhood is still known by that name. The correct spelling of
the name of the place in Penfro was probably &#7930;onyon, but it is
variously given as &#7930;onwen, &#7930;onyon, and &#7930;onion, not to
mention the &#7930;onnio &#7930;onnwen of the later form of the Triad:
should this last prove to be based on any authority one might suggest
&#7930;onyon Henwen, so called after the sow, as the original. The
modern Welsh spelling of &#7930;onyon would be &#7930;onion, and it is
identified by Mr. Egerton Phillimore with Lanion near Pembroke<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e16306src" href="#xd26e16306" name=
"xd26e16306src">15</a>. Rhiw Gyferthwch is guessed to have been one of
the slopes of Snowdon on the Be&#273;gelert side; but I have failed to
discover anybody who has ever heard the name used in that
neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Ar&#7931;echwe&#273; was, roughly speaking, that part of
Carnarvonshire <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb507" href="#v2pb507"
name="v2pb507">507</a>]</span>which drains into the sea between Conway
and Bangor. Brynach and Menwaed or Mengwaed<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e16316src" href="#xd26e16316" name="xd26e16316src">16</a> seem to
be the names underlying the misreadings in ii. 56; but it is quite
possible that Brynach, probably for an Irish Bronach, has here
superseded an earlier Urnach or Eurnach also a Goidel, to whom I shall
have to return in another chapter. Dinas Affaraon<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e16379src" href="#xd26e16379" name="xd26e16379src">17</a> is the
place called <i lang="cy">Dinas Ffaraon Dande</i> in the story of
&#7930;ud and &#7930;evelys, where we are told that after &#7930;ud had
had the two dragons buried there, which had been dug up at the centre
of his realm, to wit at Oxford, Ffaraon, after whom the place was
called, died of grief. Later it came to be called Dinas Emrys from
Myr&#273;in Emrys, &lsquo;Merlinus Ambrosius,&rsquo; who induced
Vortigern to go away from there in quest of another place to build his
castle<a class="noteref" id="xd26e16388src" href="#xd26e16388" name=
"xd26e16388src">18</a>. So the reader will see that the mention of this
Dinas brings us back to a weird spot with which he has been
familiarized in the previous chapter: see pp. 469, 495 above.
&#7930;anfair in Arfon is &#7930;anfair Is-gaer near Port Dinorwic on
the Menai Straits, and the Maen Du should be a black rock or black
stone on the southern side of those straits. Daronwy and Cath Paluc are
both personages on whom light is still wanted. Lastly, by Edwin king of
England is to be understood Edwin <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb508" href="#v2pb508" name="v2pb508">508</a>]</span>king of the
Angles of Deira and Bernicia, whom Welsh tradition represents as having
found refuge for a time in Anglesey.</p>
<p>Now this story as a whole looks like a sort of device for stringing
together explanations of the origin of certain place-names and of
certain local characteristics. Leaving entirely out of the reckoning
the whole of Mid-Wales, that is to say, the more Brythonic portion of
the country, it is remarkable as giving to South Wales credit for
certain resources, but to North Wales for pests alone and scourges,
except that the writer of the late version bethought himself of
&#7930;eyn and Eifiony&#273; as having good land for growing rye; but
he was very hazy as to the geography of North Wales&mdash;both he and
the redactors of the other Triads equally belonged doubtless to South
Wales. Among the place-names, Maes Gwenith, &lsquo;the Wheat
Field,&rsquo; is clear; but hardly less so is the case of Aber Torogi,
&lsquo;Mouth of the Troggy,&rsquo; where <i>torogi</i> is &lsquo;the
pregnancy of animals,&rsquo; from <i>torrog</i>, &lsquo;being with
young.&rsquo; So with Rhiw Gyferthwch, &lsquo;the Hillside or Ascent of
<i>Cyferthwch</i>,&rsquo; where <i>cyferthwch</i> means
&lsquo;pantings, pangs, labour.&rsquo; The name Maen Du, &lsquo;Black
Rock,&rsquo; is left to explain itself; and I am not sure that the
original story was not so put as also to explain <i>&#7930;onion</i>,
to wit, as a sort of plural of <i>&#7931;awn</i>, &lsquo;full,&rsquo;
in reference, let us say, to the full ears of the barley grown there.
But the reference to the place-names seems to have partly escaped the
later tellers of the story or to have failed to impress them as worth
emphasizing. They appear to have thought more of explaining the origin
of Menwaed&rsquo;s Wolf and Brynach&rsquo;s Eagle. Whether this means
in the former case that the district of Ar&#7931;echwe&#273; was more
infested by wolves than any other part of Wales, or that Menwaed, lord
of Ar&#7931;echwe&#273;, had a wolf as his symbol, it is impossible to
say. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb509" href="#v2pb509" name=
"v2pb509">509</a>]</span>In another Triad, however, i. 23 = ii. 57, he
is reckoned one of the Three Battle-knights who were favourites at
Arthur&rsquo;s court, the others being Caradog Freichfras and &#7930;yr
&#7930;&uuml;y&#273;og or &#7930;u&#273; &#7930;urugog, while in iii.
29 Menwaed&rsquo;s place is taken by a son of his called Mael Hir.
Similarly with regard to Brynach&rsquo;s Eagle one has nothing to say,
except that common parlance some time or other would seem to have
associated the eagle in some way with Brynach the Goidel. The former
prevalence of the eagle in the Snowdon district seems to be the
explanation of its Welsh name of Eryri&mdash;as already suggested, p.
479 above&mdash;and the association of the bird with the Goidelic
chieftain who had his stronghold under the shadow of Snowdon seems to
follow naturally enough. But the details are conspicuous by their
scarcity in Welsh literature, though Brynach&rsquo;s Eagle is probably
to be identified with the <i lang="la">Aquila Fabulosa</i> of Eryri, of
which Giraldus makes a curious mention<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e16426src" href="#xd26e16426" name="xd26e16426src">19</a>. Perhaps
the final disuse of Goidelic speech in the district is to be, to some
extent, regarded as accounting for our dearth of data. A change of
language involved in all probability the shipwreck of many a familiar
mode of thought; and many a homely expression must have been lost in
the transition before an equivalent acceptable to the Goidel was
discovered by him in his adopted idiom.</p>
<p>This question of linguistic change will be found further illustrated
by the story to which I wish now to pass, namely that of the hunting of
Twrch Trwyth. It is one of those incorporated in the larger tale known
as that of Kulhwch and Olwen, the hero and heroine concerned: see the
Oxford <i>Mabinogion</i>, pp. 135&ndash;41, and Guest&rsquo;s
translation, iii. 306&ndash;16. Twrch Trwyth is pictured as a
formidable boar at the head of his offspring, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb510" href="#v2pb510" name=
"v2pb510">510</a>]</span>consisting of seven swine, and the Twrch
himself is represented as carrying between his ears a comb, a razor,
and a pair of shears. The plot of the Kulhwch renders it necessary that
these precious articles should be procured; so Kulhwch prevails on his
cousin Arthur to undertake the hunt. Arthur began by sending one of his
men, to wit, Menw<a class="noteref" id="xd26e16438src" href=
"#xd26e16438" name="xd26e16438src">20</a> son of Teirgwae&#273;, to see
whether the three precious things mentioned were really where they were
said to be, namely, between Twrch Trwyth&rsquo;s ears. Menw was a great
magician who usually formed one of any party of Arthur&rsquo;s men
about to visit a pagan country; for it was his business to subject the
inhabitants to magic and enchantment, so that they should not see
Arthur&rsquo;s men, while the latter saw them. Menw found Twrch Trwyth
and his offspring at a place in Ireland called Esgeir Oervel<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e16450src" href="#xd26e16450" name=
"xd26e16450src">21</a>, and in order to approach them he alighted in
the form of a bird near where they were. He tried to snatch one of the
three precious articles from Twrch Trwyth, but he only succeeded in
securing one of his bristles, whereupon the Twrch stood up and shook
himself so vigorously that a drop of venom from his bristles fell on
Menw, who never enjoyed a day&rsquo;s health afterwards as long as he
lived. Menw now returned and assured Arthur that the treasures were
really about the Twrch&rsquo;s head as it was reported. Arthur then
crossed to Ireland with a host and did not stop until he found Twrch
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb511" href="#v2pb511" name=
"v2pb511">511</a>]</span>Trwyth and his swine at Esgeir Oervel. The
hunt began and was continued for several days, but it did not prevent
the Twrch from laying waste <i>a fifth part</i> of Ireland, that is in
Medieval Irish <i>c&oacute;iced</i>, a province of the island.
Arthur&rsquo;s men, however, succeeded in killing one of the
Twrch&rsquo;s offspring, and they asked Arthur the history<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e16468src" href="#xd26e16468" name=
"xd26e16468src">22</a> of that swine. Arthur replied that it had been a
king before being transformed by God into a swine on account of his
sins. Here I should remark by the way, that the narrator of the story
forgets the death of this young boar, and continues to reckon the
Twrch&rsquo;s herd as seven.</p>
<p>Arthur&rsquo;s next move was to send one of his men, Gwrhyr,
interpreter of tongues<a class="noteref" id="xd26e16480src" href=
"#xd26e16480" name="xd26e16480src">23</a>, to parley with the boars.
Gwrhyr, in the form of a bird, alighted above where Twrch Trwyth and
his swine lay, and addressed them as follows: &lsquo;For the sake of
Him who fashioned you in this shape, if you can speak, I ask one of you
to come to converse with Arthur.&rsquo; Answer was made by one of the
boars, called Grugyn Gwrych Ereint, that is, Grugyn Silver-bristle; for
like feathers of silver, we are told, were his bristles wherever he
went, and whether in woods or on plains, one saw the gleam of his
bristles. The following, then, was Grugyn&rsquo;s answer: &lsquo;By Him
who fashioned us in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb512" href=
"#v2pb512" name="v2pb512">512</a>]</span>this shape, we shall not do
so, and we shall not converse with Arthur. Enough evil has God done to
us when He fashioned us in this shape, without your coming to fight
with us.&rsquo; Gwrhyr replied: &lsquo;I tell you that Arthur will
fight for the comb, the razor, and the shears that are between the ears
of Twrch Trwyth.&rsquo; &lsquo;Until his life has first been
taken,&rsquo; said Grugyn, &lsquo;those trinkets shall not be taken,
and to-morrow morning we set out hence for Arthur&rsquo;s own country,
and all the harm we can, shall we do there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The boars accordingly set out for Wales, while Arthur with his host,
his horses, and his hounds, on board his ship <i>Prydwen</i>, kept
within sight of them. Twrch Trwyth came to land at Porth Clais, a small
creek south of St. David&rsquo;s, but Arthur went that night to Mynyw,
which seems to have been Menevia or St. David&rsquo;s. The next day
Arthur was told that the boars had gone past, and he overtook them
killing the herds of Kynnwas Cwrvagyl, after they had destroyed all
they could find in Deugle&#273;yf, whether man or beast. Then the Twrch
went as far as Presseleu, a name which survives in that of Preselly or
Precelly, as in Preselly Top and Preselly Mountains in North
Pembrokeshire. Arthur and his men began the hunt again, while his
warriors were ranged on both sides of the <i>Nyfer</i> or the river
Nevern. The Twrch then left the Glen of the Nevern and made his way to
Cwm Kerwyn, the name of which survives in that of Moel Cwm Kerwyn, one
of the Preselly heights. In the course of the hunt in that district the
Twrch killed Arthur&rsquo;s four champions and many of the people of
the country. He was next overtaken in a district called
Peuliniauc<a class="noteref" id="xd26e16508src" href="#xd26e16508"
name="xd26e16508src">24</a> or Peuliniog, which appears <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb513" href="#v2pb513" name=
"v2pb513">513</a>]</span>to have occupied a central area between the
mountains, &#7930;an&#273;ewi Velfrey, Hen&#7931;an Amgoed, and
Laugharne: it probably covered portions of the parish of Whitland and
of that of &#7930;andysilio, the church of which is a little to the
north of the railway station of Clyn Derwen on the Great Western line.
Leaving Peuliniog for the Laugharne Burrows, he crossed, as it seems,
from Ginst Point to <i lang="cy">Aber Towy</i> or Towy Mouth<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e16538src" href="#xd26e16538" name=
"xd26e16538src">25</a>, which at low water are separated mostly by
tracts of sand interrupted only by one or two channels of no very
considerable width; for Aber Towy would seem to have been a little
south-east of St. Ishmael&rsquo;s, on the eastern bank of the Towy.
Thence the Twrch makes his way to <i lang="cy">Glynn Ystu</i>, more
correctly perhaps <i lang="cy">Clyn Ystun</i>, now written <i lang=
"cy">Clyn Ystyn</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e16552src" href=
"#xd26e16552" name="xd26e16552src">26</a>, the name of a farm between
Carmarthen and the junction of the Amman with the &#7930;ychwr, more
exactly about six miles from that junction and about <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb514" href="#v2pb514" name=
"v2pb514">514</a>]</span>eight and a half from Carmarthen as the crow
flies. The hunt is resumed in the Valley of the &#7930;ychwr or
Loughor<a class="noteref" id="xd26e16596src" href="#xd26e16596" name=
"xd26e16596src">27</a>, where Grugyn and another young boar, called
&#7930;wydawc Gouynnyat<a class="noteref" id="xd26e16621src" href=
"#xd26e16621" name="xd26e16621src">28</a>, committed terrible ravages
among the huntsmen. This brought Arthur and his host to the rescue, and
Twrch Trwyth, on his part, came to help his boars; but as a tremendous
attack was now made on him he moved away, leaving the &#7930;ychwr, and
making eastwards for Myny&#273; Amanw, or &lsquo;the Mountain of
Amman,&rsquo; for Amanw is plentifully preserved in that neighbourhood
in the shortened form of Aman or Amman<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e16645src" href="#xd26e16645" name="xd26e16645src">29</a>. On
Myny&#273; Amanw one of his boars was killed, but he is not
distinguished by any proper name: he is simply called a <i>banw</i>,
&lsquo;a young boar.&rsquo; The Twrch was again hard pressed, and lost
another called Twrch &#7930;awin. Then a third of the swine is killed,
called Gwys, whereupon Twrch Trwyth went to Dyffryn Amanw, or the Vale
of Amman, where he lost a <i>banw</i> and a <i>benwic</i>, a
&lsquo;boar&rsquo; and a &lsquo;sow.&rsquo; All this evidently takes
place in the same district, and Myny&#273; Amanw was, if not Bryn
Amman, probably one of the mountains to the south or south-east of the
river Amman, so that Dyffryn Amanw may have been what is still called
Dyffryn Amman, or the Valley of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb515" href="#v2pb515" name="v2pb515">515</a>]</span>Amman from Bryn
Amman to where the river Amman falls into the &#7930;ychwr. From the
Amman the Twrch and the two remaining boars of his herd made their way
to &#7930;wch Ewin, &lsquo;the lake or pool of Ewin,&rsquo; which is
now represented by a bog mere above a farm house called &#7930;wch in
the parish of Bettws, which covers the southern slope of the Amman
Valley. I have found this bog called in a map <i lang="cy">&#7930;wch
is Awel</i>, &lsquo;Pool below Breeze,&rsquo; whatever that may
mean.</p>
<p>We find them next at <i lang="cy">&#7930;wch Tawi</i>, the position
of which is indicated by that of <i lang="cy">Ynys Pen &#7930;wch</i>,
&lsquo;Pool&rsquo;s End Isle,&rsquo; some distance lower down the Tawe
than Pont ar Dawe. At this point the boars separate, and Grugyn goes
away to Din Tywi, &lsquo;Towy Fort,&rsquo; an unidentified position
somewhere on the Towy, possibly Grongar Hill near &#7930;andeilo, and
thence to a place in Keredigion where he was killed, namely, Garth
Grugyn. I have not yet been able to identify the spot, though it must
have once had a castle, as we read of a castle called Garthgrugyn being
strengthened by Maelgwn Vychan in the year 1242: the <i>Bruts</i>
locate it in Keredigion<a class="noteref" id="xd26e16686src" href=
"#xd26e16686" name="xd26e16686src">30</a>, but this part of the story
is obscured by careless copying on the part of the scribe<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e16698src" href="#xd26e16698" name=
"xd26e16698src">31</a> of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb516"
href="#v2pb516" name="v2pb516">516</a>]</span><i>Red Book</i>. After
Grugyn&rsquo;s death we read of &#7930;wydawc having made his way to
Ystrad Yw, and, after inflicting slaughter on several of his
assailants, he is himself killed there. Now Ystrad Yw, which our
mapsters would have us call <i lang="cy">Ystrad Wy</i>, as if it had
been on the Wye<a class="noteref" id="xd26e16718src" href="#xd26e16718"
name="xd26e16718src">32</a>, is supposed to have covered till Henry
VIII&rsquo;s time the same area approximately as the hundred of
Crickhowel has since, namely, the parishes of (1) Crickhowel, (2)
&#7930;anbedr Ystrad Yw with Patrishow, (3) &#7930;anfihangel Cwm Du
with Tretower and Penmyarth, (4) &#7930;angattock with &#7930;angenny,
(5) &#7930;ane&#7931;y with Brynmawr, and (6) &#7930;angynidr. Of these
&#7930;anbedr perpetuates the name of Ystrad Yw, although it is
situated near the junction of the Greater and Lesser Grwyn&euml; and
not in the Strath of the Yw, which <i lang="cy">Ystrad Yw</i> means. So
one can only treat <i lang="cy">Lanbedr Ystrad Yw</i> as meaning that
particular &#7930;anbedr or St. Peter&rsquo;s Church which belongs to
the district comprehensively called Ystrad Yw. Now if one glances at
the <i>Red Book</i> list of cantreds and cymwds, dating in the latter
part of the fourteenth century, one will find <i lang="cy">Ystrad
Yw</i> and <i>Cruc Howel</i> existing as separate cymwds. So we have to
look for the former in the direction of the parish of Cwm Du; and on
going back to the <i>Taxatio</i> of Pope Nicholas IV dating about 1291,
we find that practically we have to identify with Cwm Du a name
<i>Stratden&rsquo;</i>, p. 273<sup>a</sup>, which one is probably to
treat as <i>Strat d&rsquo;Eue</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e16758src"
href="#xd26e16758" name="xd26e16758src">33</a> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb517" href="#v2pb517" name=
"v2pb517">517</a>]</span>or some similar Norman spelling; for most of
the other parishes of the district are mentioned by the names which
they still bear. That is not all; for from Cwm Du a tributary of the
Usk called the Rhiango&#7931; comes down and receives at Tretower the
waters of a smaller stream called the Yw. The land on both sides of
that Yw burn forms the <i>ystrad</i> or strath of which we are in
quest. The chief source of this water is called <i>&#7930;ygad Yw</i>,
and gives its name to a house of some pretensions bearing an
inscription showing that it was built in its present form about the
middle of the seventeenth century by a member of the Gunter family well
known in the history of the county. Near the house stands a yew tree on
the boundary line of the garden, and close to its trunk, but at a lower
level, is a spring of bubbling water: this is <i>&#7930;ygad Yw</i>,
&lsquo;the Eye of the Yw.&rsquo; For <i>&#7930;ygad Yw</i> is a
succinct expression for the source of the Yw burn<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e16791src" href="#xd26e16791" name="xd26e16791src">34</a>, and the
stream retains the name <i>Yw</i> to its fall into the Rhiango&#7931;;
but besides the spring of <i>Llygad Yw</i> it has several other similar
sources in the fields near the house. There is nothing, however, in
this brook to account for the name of Ystrad <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb518" href="#v2pb518" name=
"v2pb518">518</a>]</span>Yw having been extended to an important
district; but if one traces its short course one will at once guess the
explanation. For a few fields below &#7930;ygad Yw is the hamlet of the
<i>Gaer</i> or fortress, consisting of four farm houses called the
Upper, Middle, and Lower Gaer, and Pen y Gaer: through this hamlet of
the Gaer flows the Yw. These, and more especially Pen y Gaer, are
supposed to have been the site of a Roman camp of considerable
importance, and close by it the Yw is supposed to have been crossed by
the Roman road proceeding towards Brecon<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e16856src" href="#xd26e16856" name="xd26e16856src">35</a>. The
camp in the Strath of the Yw was the head quarters of the ruling power
in the district, and hence the application of the name of Ystrad Yw to
a wider area. But for our story one has to regard the name as confined
to the land about the Yw burn, or at most to a somewhat larger portion
of the parish of Cwm Du, to which the Yw and Tretower belong. The
position of the Gaer in Ystrad Yw at the foot of the Bwlch or the gap
in the difficult mountain spur stretching down towards the Usk is more
likely to have been selected by the Romans than by any of the Celtic
inhabitants, whose works are to be found on several of the neighbouring
hills, such as Myarth<a class="noteref" id="xd26e16865src" href=
"#xd26e16865" name="xd26e16865src">36</a> between the Yw and the Usk.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb519" href="#v2pb519" name=
"v2pb519">519</a>]</span></p>
<p>We next find Twrch Trwyth, now the sole survivor, making his way
towards the Severn: so Arthur summons Cornwall and Devon to meet him at
Aber Hafren or Severn mouth. Then a furious conflict with the Twrch
takes place in the very waters of that river, between &#7930;yn
&#7930;iwan (p. 407) and Aber Gwy or the mouth of the Wye. After much
trouble, Arthur&rsquo;s men succeed in getting possession of two out of
the three treasures of the boar, but he escapes with the third, namely,
the comb, across the Severn<a class="noteref" id="xd26e16882src" href=
"#xd26e16882" name="xd26e16882src">37</a>. Then as soon as he gets
ashore he makes his way to Cornwall, where the comb is at length
snatched from him. Chased thence, he goes straight into the sea, with
the hounds Anet and Aethlem after him, and nothing has ever been heard
of any of the three from that day to this.</p>
<p>That is the story of Twrch Trwyth, and Dr. Stokes calls my attention
to a somewhat similar hunt briefly described in the Rennes
<i>Dinds&#775;enchas</i> in the <i lang="fr">Revue Celtique</i>, xv.
474&ndash;5. Then as to the precious articles carried by the Twrch
about his head and ears, the comb, the razor, and the shears, two out
of the three&mdash;the comb and the razor&mdash;belong to the regular
stock of a certain group of tales which recount how the hero elopes
with the daughter of a giant who loses his life in the pursuit<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e16893src" href="#xd26e16893" name=
"xd26e16893src">38</a>. In order to make sure of escaping from the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb520" href="#v2pb520" name=
"v2pb520">520</a>]</span>infuriated giant, the daughter abstracts from
her father&rsquo;s keeping a comb, a razor, and another article. When
she and her lover fleeing on their horse are hard pressed, the latter
throws behind him the comb, which at once becomes a rough impenetrable
forest to detain the giant for a while. When he is again on the point
of overtaking them, the lover throws behind him the razor, which
becomes a steep and sharp mountain ridge through which the pursuing
giant has to waste time tunnelling his way. The third article is
usually such as, when thrown in the giant&rsquo;s way, becomes a lake
in which he is drowned while attempting to swim across. In the Kulhwch
story, however, as we have it, the allusion to these objects is torn
away from what might be expected as its context. The giant is
Yspa&#273;aden Penkawr, whose death is effected in another way; but
before the giant is finally disposed of he requires to be shaved and to
have his hair dressed. His hair, moreover, is so rough that the
dressing cannot be done without the comb and shears in the possession
of Twrch Trwyth, whence the hunt; and for the shaving one would have
expected the Twrch&rsquo;s razor to have been requisite; but not so, as
the shaving had to be done by means of another article, namely, the
tusk of <i lang="cy">Yskithyrwynn Pennbei&#273;</i>, &lsquo;White-tusk
chief of Boars,&rsquo; for the obtaining of which one is treated
briefly to another boar hunt. The Kulhwch story is in this respect very
mixed and disjointed, owing, it would seem, to the determination of the
narrator to multiply the number of things difficult to procure, each
involving a separate feat to be described.</p>
<p>Let us now consider the hunt somewhat more in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb521" href="#v2pb521" name=
"v2pb521">521</a>]</span>detail, with special reference to the names
mentioned; and let us begin with that of Twrch Trwyth: the word
<i>twrch</i> means the male of a beast of the swine kind, and <i>twrch
coed</i>, &lsquo;a wood pig,&rsquo; is a wild boar, while <i>twrch
daear</i>, &lsquo;an earth pig,&rsquo; is the word in North Wales for a
mole. In the next place we can practically equate <i>Twrch Trwyth</i>
with a name at the head of one of the articles in Cormac&rsquo;s
<i>Irish Glossary</i>. There the exact form is <i>Orc
tr&eacute;ith</i>, and the following is the first part of the article
itself as given in O&rsquo;Donovan&rsquo;s translation edited by
Stokes:&mdash;&lsquo;<i>Orc Tr&eacute;ith</i>, <i>i. e. nomen</i> for a
king&rsquo;s son, <i>triath enim rex vocatur, unde dixit poeta
O&iacute;nach n-uirc tr&eacute;ith</i> &ldquo;fair of a king&rsquo;s
son,&rdquo; i. e. food and precious raiment, down and quilts, ale and
flesh-meat, chessmen and chessboards, horses and chariots, greyhounds
and playthings besides.&rsquo; In this extract the word <i>orc</i>
occurs in the genitive as <i>uirc</i>, and it means a &lsquo;pig&rsquo;
or &lsquo;boar&rsquo;; in fact it is, with the usual Celtic loss of the
consonant <i>p</i>, the exact Goidelic equivalent of the Latin
<i>porcus</i>, genitive <i>porci</i>. From another article in
Cormac&rsquo;s <i>Glossary</i>, we learn that <i>Tr&eacute;ith</i> is
the genitive of <i>Triath</i>, which has been explained to mean a king.
Thus, <i>Orc Tr&eacute;ith</i> means Triath&rsquo;s <i>Orc</i>,
Triath&rsquo;s Boar, or the King&rsquo;s Boar; so we take Twrch Trwyth
in the same way to mean &lsquo;Trwyth&rsquo;s Boar.&rsquo; But we have
here a discrepancy, which the reader will have noticed, for
<i>twrch</i> is not the same word as Irish <i>orc</i>, the nearest form
to be expected in Welsh being <i>Wrch</i>, not <i>Twrch</i>; but such a
word as <i>Wrch</i> does not, so far as I know, exist. Now did the
Welsh render <i>orc</i> by a different word unrelated to the Goidelic
one which they heard? I think not; for it is remarkable that Irish has
besides <i>orc</i> a word <i>torc</i>, meaning a &lsquo;boar,&rsquo;
and <i>torc</i> is exactly the Welsh <i>twrch</i>. So there seems to be
no objection to our supposing that what Cormac calls <i>Orc
Tr&eacute;ith</i> was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb522" href=
"#v2pb522" name="v2pb522">522</a>]</span>known in the Goidelic of Wales
as <i>Torc Tr&eacute;ith</i>, which had the alliteration to recommend
it to popular favour. In that case one could say that the Goidelic name
<i>Torc Tr&eacute;ith</i> appears in Welsh with a minimum of change as
<i>Twrch Trwyth</i>, and also with the stamp of popular favour more
especially in the retention of the Goidelic <i>th</i>, just as in the
name of an ancient camp or fortification on the Withy Bush Estate in
Pembrokeshire: it is called the <i>Rath</i>, or the <i>Rath Ring</i>.
Here <i>r&#257;th</i> is identical with the Irish word <i lang=
"ga">r&aacute;th</i>, &lsquo;a fortification or earthworks,&rsquo; and
we seem to have it also in <i lang="ga">Cil R&acirc;th Fawr</i>, the
name of a farm in the neighbourhood of Narberth. Now the Goidelic word
<i>tr&eacute;ith</i> appears to have come into Welsh as
<i>tr&#275;th-i</i>, the long vowel of which must in Welsh have become
<i>oi</i> or <i>ui</i> by about the end of the sixth century; and if
the <i>th</i> had been treated on etymological principles its proper
equivalent in the Welsh of that time would have been <i>d</i> or
<i>t</i>. The retention of the <i>th</i> is a proof, therefore, of oral
transmission; that is to say, the Goidelic word passed bodily into
Brythonic, to submit afterwards to the phonological rules of that
language.</p>
<p>A little scrutiny of the tale will, I think, convince the reader
that one of the objects of the original story-teller was to account for
certain place-names. Thus Grugyn was meant to account for the name of
Garth Grugyn, where Grugyn was killed; Gwys, to account similarly for
that of Gwys, a tributary of the Twrch, which gives its name to a
station on the line of railway between Ystalyfera and Bryn Amman; and
Twrch &#7930;awin to account for the name of the river Twrch, which
receives the Gwys, and falls into the Tawe some distance below Ystrad
Gynlais, between the counties of Brecknock and Glamorgan.</p>
<p>Besides Grugyn and Twrch &#7930;awin, there was a third <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb523" href="#v2pb523" name=
"v2pb523">523</a>]</span>brother to whom the story gives a special
name, to wit, &#7930;wydawc Gouynnyat, and this was, I take it, meant
also to account for a place-name, which, however, is not given: it
should have been somewhere in Ystrad Yw, in the county of Brecknock.
Still greater interest attaches to the swine that have not been
favoured with names of their own, those referred to simply as
<i>banw</i>, &lsquo;a young boar,&rsquo; and <i>benwic</i>, &lsquo;a
young sow.&rsquo; Now <i>banw</i> has its equivalent in Irish in the
word <i>banbh</i>, which O&rsquo;Reilly explains as meaning a
&lsquo;sucking pig,&rsquo; and that is the meaning also of the Manx
<i>bannoo</i>; but formerly the word may have had a somewhat wider
meaning. The Welsh appellative is introduced twice into the story of
Twrch Trwyth; once to account, as I take it, for the name Myny&#273;
Amanw, &lsquo;Amman Mountain,&rsquo; and once for Dyffryn Amanw,
&lsquo;Amman Valley.&rsquo; In both instances Amanw was meant, as I
think, to be accounted for by the <i>banw</i> killed at each of the
places in question. But how, you will ask, does the word <i>banw</i>
account for <i>Amanw</i>, or throw any light on it at all? Very simply,
if you will just suppose the name to have been Goidelic; for then you
have only to provide it with the definite article and it makes <i>in
banbh</i>, &lsquo;the pig or the boar,&rsquo; and that could not in
Welsh yield anything but <i>ymmanw</i> or <i>ammanw</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e17107src" href="#xd26e17107" name=
"xd26e17107src">39</a>, which with the accent shifted backwards, became
<i>Ammanw</i> and <i>Amman</i> or <i>Aman</i>.</p>
<p>Having premised these explanations let us, before we proceed
further, see to what our evidence exactly amounts. Here, then, we have
a mention of seven <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb524" href=
"#v2pb524" name="v2pb524">524</a>]</span>swine, but as two of them, a
<i>banw</i> and a <i>benwic</i>, are killed at one and the same place,
our figure is practically reduced to six<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e17168src" href="#xd26e17168" name="xd26e17168src">40</a>. The
question then is, in how many of these six cases the story of the hunt
accounts for the names of the places of the deaths respectively, that
is to say, accounts for them in the ordinary way with which one is
familiar in other Welsh stories. They may be enumerated as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. A <i>banw</i> is killed at Myny&#273; <i>Amanw</i>.</p>
<p>2. A <i>twrch</i> is killed in the same neighbourhood, where there
is a river <i>Twrch</i>.</p>
<p>3. A swine called <i>Gwys</i> is killed in the same neighbourhood
still, where there is a river called <i>Gwys</i>, falling into the
Twrch.</p>
<p>4. A <i>banw</i> and a <i>benwic</i> are killed in Dyffryn
<i>Amanw</i>.</p>
<p>5. Grugyn is killed at a place called Garth <i>Grugyn</i>.</p>
<p>6. A swine called &#7930;wydawc is killed at a spot, not named, in
Ystrad Yw or not far off<a class="noteref" id="xd26e17217src" href=
"#xd26e17217" name="xd26e17217src">41</a>.</p>
<p>Thus in five cases out of the six, the story accounts for the
place-name, and the question now is, can that be a mere accident? Just
think what the probabilities of the case would be if you put them into
numbers: South Wales, from St. David&rsquo;s to the Vale of the Usk,
would supply hundreds of place-names as deserving of mention, to say
the least, as those in this story; is it likely then that out of a
given six among them no less than five should be accounted for or
alluded to by any mere accident in the course of a story of the brevity
of that of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb525" href="#v2pb525" name=
"v2pb525">525</a>]</span>Twrch Trwyth. To my thinking such an accident
is inconceivable, and I am forced, therefore, to suppose that the
narrative was originally so designed as to account for them. I said
&lsquo;originally so designed,&rsquo; for the scribe of the <i>Red
Book</i>, or let us say the last redactor of the story as it stands in
the <i>Red Book</i>, shows no signs of having noticed any such design.
Had he detected the play on the names of the places introduced, he
would probably have been more inclined to develop that feature of the
story than to efface it.</p>
<p>What I mean may best be illustrated by another swine story, namely,
that which has already been referred to as occurring in the
<i>Mabinogi</i> of Math. There we find Pryderi, king of Dyfed, holding
his court at Rhu&#273;lan on the Teifi, but though he had become the
proud possessor of a new race of animals, given him as a present by his
friend Arawn, king of Annwn, he had made a solemn promise to his
people, that he should give none of them away until they had doubled
their number in Dyfed: these animals were the <i>hobeu</i> or pigs to
which reference was made at p. 69 above. Now Gwydion, having heard of
them, visited Pryderi&rsquo;s court, and by magic and enchantment
deceived the king. Successful in his quest, he sets out for Gwyne&#273;
with his <i>hobeu</i>, and this is how his journey is described in the
<i>Mabinogi</i>: &lsquo;And that evening they journeyed as far as the
upper end of Keredigion, to a place which is still called, for that
reason, Mochdref, &ldquo;Swine-town or Pigs&rsquo; stead.&rdquo; On the
morrow they went their way, and came across the Elenyd mountains, and
that night they spent between Kerry and Arwystli, in the stead which is
also called for that reason Mochdref. Thence they proceeded, and came
the same evening as far as a commot in Powys, which is for that reason
called <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb526" href="#v2pb526" name=

href="#xd26e17269" name="xd26e17269src">42</a>,
&ldquo;Swine-burn.&rdquo; Thence they journeyed to the cantred of
Rh&ocirc;s, and spent that night within the town which is still called
Mochdref<a class="noteref" id="xd26e17272src" href="#xd26e17272" name=
"xd26e17272src">43</a>.&rsquo; &lsquo;Ah, my men,&rsquo; said Gwydion,
&lsquo;let us make for the fastness of Gwyne&#273; with these beasts:
the country is being raised in pursuit of us.&rsquo; So this is what
they did: they made for the highest town of Ar&#7931;echwe&#273;, and
there built a <i>creu</i> or sty for the pigs, and for that reason the
town was called <i>Creu-Wyrion</i>, that is, perhaps,
&lsquo;Wyrion&rsquo;s Sty.&rsquo; In this, it is needless to state, we
have the Corwrion of chap. i: see pp. 47, 50&ndash;70 above&mdash;the
name is variously pronounced also <i>Cyrwrion</i> and
<i>C&rsquo;rwrion</i>.</p>
<p>That is how a portion of the Math story is made to account for a
series of place-names, and had the editor of the Kulhwch understood the
play on the names of places in question in the story of Twrch Trwyth,
it might be expected that he would have given it prominence, as already
suggested. Then comes the question, how it came to pass that he did not
understand it? The first thing to suggest itself as an answer is, that
he may have been a stranger to the geography of the country concerned.
That, however, is a very inadequate explanation; for his being a
stranger, though it might account for his making blunders as to the
localities, would not be likely to deter him from venturing into
geography which he had not mastered.</p>
<p>What was it, then, that hid from him a portion of the original in
this instance? In part, at least, it must have been a difficulty of
language. Let us take an illustration: Gwys has already been mentioned
more than once as a name applied to one of Twrch Trwyth&rsquo;s
offspring, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb527" href="#v2pb527" name=
"v2pb527">527</a>]</span>and the words used are very brief, to the
following effect:&mdash;&lsquo;And then another of his swine was
killed: Gwys was its name.&rsquo; As a matter of fact, the scribe was
labouring under a mistake, for he ought to have said rather, &lsquo;And
then another of his swine was killed: it was a sow&rsquo;; since
<i>gwys</i> was a word meaning a sow, and not the name of any
individual hog. The word has, doubtless, long been obsolete in Welsh;
but it was known to the poet of the &lsquo;Little Pig&rsquo;s
Lullaby&rsquo; in the <i>Black Book of Carmarthen</i>, where one of the
stanzas begins, fo. 29<sup>a</sup>, with the line:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line"><i>Oian aparchellan. aparchell. guin guis.</i></p>
</div>
<p class="first">The late Dr. Pughe translated it thus:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Listen, little porkling! thou forward little white
pig.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">I fear I should be obliged to render it less
elegantly:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Lullaby, little porker, white sow porker.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">For the last four words Stokes suggests &lsquo;O
pigling of a white sow&rsquo;; but perhaps the most natural rendering
of the words would be &lsquo;O white porker of a
sow!&rsquo;&mdash;which does not recommend itself greatly on the score
of sense, I must admit. The word occurs, also, in Breton as <i>gwiz</i>
or <i>gw&eacute;z</i>, &lsquo;truie, femelle du porc,&rsquo; and as
<i>gwys</i> or <i>guis</i> in Old Cornish, while in Irish it was
<i>feis</i>. Nevertheless, the editor of the Twrch Trwyth story did not
know it; but it would be in no way surprising that a Welshman, who knew
his language fairly well, should be baffled by such a word in case it
was not in use in his own district in his own time. This, however,
barely touches the fringe of the question. The range of the hunt, as
already given, was mostly within the boundaries, so to say, of the
portion of South Wales where we find Goidelic inscriptions in the Ogam
character of the fifth or sixth century; and I am persuaded that the
Goidelic <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb528" href="#v2pb528" name=
"v2pb528">528</a>]</span>language must have lived down to the sixth or
seventh century in the south and in the north of Wales<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e17338src" href="#xd26e17338" name=
"xd26e17338src">44</a>, a tract of Mid-Wales being then, probably, the
only district which can be assumed to have been completely Brythonic in
point of speech. In this very story, probably, such a name as Garth
Grugyn is but slightly modified from a Goidelic <i>Gort Grucaind</i>,
&lsquo;the enclosure of Grucand<a class="noteref" id="xd26e17347src"
href="#xd26e17347" name="xd26e17347src">45</a> or Grugan&rsquo;:
compare C&uacute;chulaind or <i>C&uacute;chulainn</i> made in Welsh
into Cocholyn. But the capital instance in the story of Twrch Trwyth as
has already been indicated is that of Amanw, which I detect also as
<i>Ammann</i> (probably to be read <i>Ammanu</i>), in the <i>Book of
&#7930;an D&acirc;v</i> (or <i lang="la">Liber Landavensis</i>), p.
199: it is there borne by a lay witness to a grant of land called Tir
Dimuner, which would appear to have been in what is now Monmouthshire.
Interpreted as standing for <i>in Banbh</i>, &lsquo;the Boar,&rsquo; it
would make a man&rsquo;s name of the same class as <i>Ibleid</i>, found
elsewhere in the same manuscript (pp. 178, 184), meaning evidently <i>i
Blei&#273;</i>, now <i>y Blai&#273;</i>, &lsquo;the Wolf.&rsquo; But
observe that the latter was Welsh and the former Goidelic, which makes
all the difference for our story. The Goidel relating the story would
say that a boar, <i>banbh</i>, was killed on the mountain or hill of
<i>in Banbh</i> or of &lsquo;the Boar&rsquo;; and his Goidelic hearer
could not fail to associate the place-name with the appellative. But a
Brython could hardly understand what the words <i>in Banbh</i> meant,
and certainly not after he had transformed them into <i>Ammanw</i>,
with the <i>nb</i> assimilated into <i>mm</i>, and the accent shifted
to the first syllable. It is needless to say that my remarks have no
meaning unless Goidelic was the original language of the tale.

<p>In the summary I have given of the hunt, I omitted a number of
proper names of the men who fell at the different spots where the Twrch
is represented brought to bay. I wish now to return to them with the
question, why were their names inserted in the story at all? It may be
suspected that they also, or at any rate some of them, were intended to
explain place-names; but I must confess to having had little success in
identifying traces of them in the ordnance maps. Others, however, may
fare better, who have a better acquaintance with the districts in
point, and in that hope I append them in their order in the
story:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. Arthur sends to the hunt on the banks of the Nevern, in
Pembrokeshire, his men, Eli and Trachmyr, Gwarthegy&#273; son of Caw,
and Bedwyr; also <i>Tri meib Cle&#273;yv Divwlch</i>, &lsquo;three Sons
of the Gapless Sword.&rsquo; The dogs are also mentioned: Drudwyn,
Greid son of Eri&rsquo;s whelp, led by Arthur himself; Glythmyr
Ledewig&rsquo;s two dogs, led by Gwarthegy&#273; son of Caw; and
Arthur&rsquo;s dog Cava&#7931;, led by Bedwyr.</p>
<p>2. Twrch Trwyth makes for Cwm Kerwyn in the Preselly Mountains, and
turns to bay, killing the following men, who are called Arthur&rsquo;s
four <i>rhyswyr</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e17416src" href=
"#xd26e17416" name="xd26e17416src">46</a> or
champions&mdash;Gwarthegy&#273; son of Caw, Tarawg of A&#7931;t Clwyd,
Rhei&#273;wn son of Eli Atver, and Iscovan Hael.</p>
<p>3. He turns to bay a second time in Cwm Kerwyn, and kills Gwydre son
of Arthur, Garselid Wy&#273;el, Glew son of Yscawt, and Iscawyn son of
Bannon or Panon.</p>
<p>4. Next day he is overtaken in the same neighbourhood, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb530" href="#v2pb530" name=
"v2pb530">530</a>]</span>and he kills Glewlwyd Gavaelvawr&rsquo;s three
men, Huandaw, Gogigwr, and Penn Pingon, many of the men of the country
also, and Gwly&#273;yn Saer, one of Arthur&rsquo;s chief
architects.</p>
<p>5. Arthur overtakes the Twrch next in Peuliniauc (p. 512 above); and
the Twrch there kills Madawc son of Teithion, Gwyn son of Tringad son
of Neued, and Eiriawn Pen&#7931;oran.</p>
<p>6. Twrch Trwyth next turns to bay at Aber Towy, &lsquo;Towy
Mouth,&rsquo; and kills Cynlas son of Cynan, and Gwilenhin, king of
<span class="corr" id="xd26e17454" title=
"Source: Franc">France.</span></p>
<p>7. The next occasion of his killing any men whose names are given,
is when he reaches &#7930;wch Ewin (p. 515), near which he killed Echel
Vor&#273;wyd-tw&#7931;, Arwyli eil Gwy&#273;awg Gwyr, and many men and
dogs besides.</p>
<p>8. Grugyn, one of the Twrch&rsquo;s offspring, goes to Garth Grugyn
in Keredigion with Eli and Trachmyr pursuing him; but what happened to
them we are not told in consequence of the omission mentioned above (p.
515) as occurring in the manuscript.</p>
<p>9. &#7930;wydawc at bay in an uncertain locality kills Rudvyw
Rys<a class="noteref" id="xd26e17464src" href="#xd26e17464" name=
"xd26e17464src">47</a> and many others. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb531" href="#v2pb531" name="v2pb531">531</a>]</span></p>
<p>10. &#7930;wydawc goes to Ystrad Yw, where he is met by the Men of
&#7930;ydaw, and he kills Hirpeissawc, king of &#7930;ydaw, also
&#7930;ygatru&#273; Emys and Gwrbothu H&ecirc;n, maternal uncles to
Arthur.</p>
<p>By way of notes on these items, I would begin with the last by
asking, what is one to make of these Men of &#7930;ydaw? First of all,
one notices that their names are singular: thus <i>Hirpeissawc</i>,
&lsquo;Long-coated or Long-robed,&rsquo; is a curious name for their
king, as it sounds more like an epithet than a name itself. Then
<i>&#7930;ygatru&#273;</i> (also <i>&#7930;ysgatru&#273;</i>, which I
cannot understand, except as a scribal error) <i>Emys</i> is also
unusual: one would have rather expected <i>Emys Lygatru&#273;</i>,
&lsquo;Emys the Red-eyed.&rsquo; As it stands it looks as if it meant
the &lsquo;Red-eyed One of Emys.&rsquo; Moreover <i>Emys</i> reminds
one of the name of Emyr &#7930;ydaw, the ancestor in Welsh hagiology of
a number of Welsh saints. It looks as if the redactor of the <i>Red
Book</i> had mistaken an <i>r</i> for an <i>s</i> in copying from a
pre-Norman original. That he had to work on such a manuscript is proved
by the remaining instance, <i>Gwrbothu H&ecirc;n</i>, &lsquo;G. the
Ancient,&rsquo; in which we have undoubtedly a pre-Norman spelling of
<i>Gwrfo&#273;w</i>: the same redactor having failed to recognize the
name, left it without being converted <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb532" href="#v2pb532" name="v2pb532">532</a>]</span>into the
spelling of his own school. In the <i>Book of &#7930;an D&acirc;v</i>
it will be found variously written <i>Gurbodu</i>, <i>Guoruodu</i>, and
<i>Guruodu</i>. Then the epithet <i>h&ecirc;n</i>, &lsquo;old or
ancient,&rsquo; reminds one of such instances as Math H&ecirc;n and
Gofynion H&ecirc;n, to be noticed a little later in this chapter. Let
us now direct the reader&rsquo;s attention for a moment to the word
<i>&#7930;ydaw</i>, in order to see whether that may not suggest
something. The etymology of it is contested, so one has to infer its
meaning, as well as one can, from the way in which it is found used.
Now it is the ordinary Welsh word for Brittany or Little Britain, and
in Irish it becomes <i>Letha</i>, which is found applied not only to
Armorica but also to Latium. Conversely one could not be surprised if a
Goidel, writing Latin, rendered his own <i>Letha</i> or the Welsh
<i>&#7930;ydaw</i> by <i>Latium</i>, even when no part of Italy was
meant. Now it so happens that &#7930;ydaw occurs in Wales itself, to
wit in the name of &#7930;yn &#7930;ydaw, a Snowdonian lake already
mentioned, p. 475. It is thus described by Pennant, ii.
339:&mdash;&lsquo;We found, on arriving at the top, an hollow a mile in
length, filled with <i>&#7930;yn &#7930;ydaw</i>, a fine lake, winding
beneath the rocks, and vastly indented by rocky projections, here and
there jutting into it. In it was one little island, the haunt of
black-backed gulls, which breed here, and, alarmed by such unexpected
visitants, broke the silence of this sequestered place by their deep
screams.&rsquo; But since Pennant&rsquo;s time mining
operations<a class="noteref" id="xd26e17754src" href="#xd26e17754"
name="xd26e17754src">48</a> have been carried on close to the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb533" href="#v2pb533" name=
"v2pb533">533</a>]</span>margin of this lake; and in the course of them
the level of the water is said to have been lowered to the extent of
sixteen feet, when, in the year 1856, an ancient canoe was discovered
there. According to the late Mr. E. L. Barnwell, who has described it
in the <i>Arch&aelig;ologia Cambrensis</i> for 1874, pp. 150&ndash;1,
it was in the possession of Dr. Griffith Griffith of Tal y
Treu&#273;yn, near Harlech, who exhibited it at the Cambrian
Arch&aelig;ological Association&rsquo;s meeting at Machyn&#7931;eth in
1866<a class="noteref" id="xd26e17770src" href="#xd26e17770" name=
"xd26e17770src">49</a>. &lsquo;It measures,&rsquo; Mr. Barnwell says,
&lsquo;nine feet nine inches&mdash;a not uncommon length in the Scotch
early canoes,&mdash;and has been hollowed out of one piece of wood, as
is universally the case with these early boats.&rsquo; He goes on to
surmise that &lsquo;this canoe may have been used to reach the island,
for the sake of birds or eggs; or what is not impossible, the island
may have been the residence of some one who had reasons for preferring
so isolated an abode. It may, in fact, have been a kind of small
natural crannog, and, in one sense, a veritable lake-dwelling, access
to and from which was easy by means of such a canoe.&rsquo; Stokes
conjectures <i>&#7930;ydaw</i> to have meant coast-land, and Thurneysen
connects it with the Sanskrit <i>p&#7771;thiv&#299;</i> and Old Saxon
<i>folda</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e17788src" href="#xd26e17788"
name="xd26e17788src">50</a>, &lsquo;earth&rsquo;: and, so far as I can
see, one is at liberty to assume a meaning that would satisfy
<i>&#7930;ydaw</i>, &lsquo;Armorica,&rsquo; and the <i>&#7930;ydaw</i>
of <i>&#7930;yn &#7930;ydaw</i>, &lsquo;the Lake of &#7930;ydaw,&rsquo;
namely that it signified land which one had to reach by boat, so that
it was in fact applicable to a lake settlement of any kind, in other
words, that <i>&#7930;ydaw</i> on Snowdon was the name of the
lake-dwelling. So <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb534" href=
"#v2pb534" name="v2pb534">534</a>]</span>I cannot help suggesting, with
great deference, that the place whence came the Men of &#7930;ydaw in
the story of the hunting of Twrch Trwyth was the settlement in
Syfa&#273;on lake (p. 73), and that the name of that stronghold,
whether it was a crannog or a stockaded islet, was also &#7930;ydaw.
For the power of that settlement over the surrounding country to have
extended a few miles around would be but natural to suppose&mdash;the
distance between the Yw and &#7930;yn Syfa&#273;on is, I am told, under
three miles. Should this guess prove well founded, we should have to
scan with renewed care the allusions in our stories to &#7930;ydaw, and
not assume that they always refer us to Brittany.</p>
<p>That the name &#7930;ydaw did on occasion refer to the region of
&#7930;yn Syfa&#273;on admits of indirect proof as follows:&mdash;The
church of &#7930;angorse on its banks is dedicated to a Saint Paulinus,
after whom also is called Capel Peulin, in the upper course of the
Towy, adjacent to the Cardiganshire parish of &#7930;an&#273;ewi Brefi.
Moreover, tradition makes Paulinus attend a synod in 519 at
&#7930;an&#273;ewi Brefi, where St. David distinguished himself by his
preaching against Pelagianism. Paulinus was then an old man, and St.
David had been one of his pupils at the <i>Ty Gwyn</i>,
&lsquo;Whitland,&rsquo; on the Taf, where Paulinus had established a
religious house<a class="noteref" id="xd26e17817src" href="#xd26e17817"
name="xd26e17817src">51</a>; and some five miles up a tributary brook
of the Taf is the church of &#7930;andysilio, where an ancient
inscription mentions a Paulinus. These two places, Whitland and
&#7930;andysilio, were probably in the cymwd of Peuliniog, which is
called after a Paulinus, and through which we have just followed the
hunt of Twrch Trwyth <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb535" href=
"#v2pb535" name="v2pb535">535</a>]</span>(p. 512). Now the inscription
to which I have referred reads<a class="noteref" id="xd26e17831src"
href="#xd26e17831" name="xd26e17831src">52</a>, with
ligatures:&mdash;</p>
<p class="xd26e2596">CLVTORIGI<br>
FILI PAVLINI<br>
MARINILATIO</p>
<p>This probably means &lsquo;(the Monument) of Clutorix, son of
Paulinus from Latium in the Marsh&rsquo;; unless one ought rather to
treat <i>Marini</i> as an epithet to <i>Paulini</i>. In either case
<i>Latio</i> has probably to be construed &lsquo;<i>of</i> or <i>from
Latium</i>&rsquo;: compare a Roman inscription found at Bath
(H&uuml;bner&rsquo;s No. 48), which begins with <i lang="la">C.
Murrius. | C. F. Arniensis | Foro. Iuli. Modestus</i><a class="noteref"
id="xd26e17882src" href="#xd26e17882" name="xd26e17882src">53</a>, and
makes in English, according to Mr. Haverfield, &lsquo;Gaius Murrius
Modestus, son of Gaius, of the tribe Arniensis, of the town Forum
Iulii.&rsquo; The easiest way to explain the last line as a whole is
probably to treat it as a compound with the qualifying word deriving
its meaning, not from <i>mare</i>, &lsquo;the sea,&rsquo; but from the
Late Latin <i>mara</i>, &lsquo;a marsh or bog.&rsquo; Thus
<i>Marini-Latium</i> would mean &lsquo;Marshy Latium,&rsquo; to
distinguish it from Latium in Italy, and from <i>Letha</i> or
<i>&#7930;ydaw</i> in the sense of Brittany, which was analogously
termed in Medieval Irish <i>Armuirc Letha</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e17918src" href="#xd26e17918" name="xd26e17918src">54</a>, that is
the Armorica of <i>Letha</i>. This is <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb536" href="#v2pb536" name="v2pb536">536</a>]</span>borne out by
the name of the church of Paulinus, which is in Welsh <i>&#7930;an y
Gors</i>, anglicized <i>&#7930;angorse</i>, &lsquo;the Church of the
Marsh or Bog,&rsquo; and that is exactly the meaning of the name given
it in the <i>Taxatio</i> of Pope Nicholas, which is that of <i>Ecclesia
de Mara</i>. In other terms, we have in the qualified <i>Latium</i> of
the inscription the Latium or Letha which came to be called in Welsh
<i>&#7930;ydaw</i>. It is, in my opinion, from that settlement as their
head quarters, that the Men of &#7930;ydaw sallied forth to take part
in the hunt in Ystrad Yw, where the boar &#7930;wydog was killed.</p>
<p>The idea that the story of Twrch Trwyth was more or less
topographical is not a new one. Lady Charlotte Guest, in her
<i>Mabinogion</i>, ii. 363&ndash;5, traces the hunt through several
places called after Arthur, such as <i>Buarth Arthur</i>,
&lsquo;Arthur&rsquo;s Cattle-pen,&rsquo; and <i>Bwr&#273; Arthur</i>,
&lsquo;Arthur&rsquo;s Table,&rsquo; besides others more miscellaneously
named, such as <i>Twyn y Moch</i>, &lsquo;the Swine&rsquo;s
Hill,&rsquo; near the source of the Amman, and <i>&#7930;wyn y
Moch</i>, &lsquo;the Swine&rsquo;s Grove,&rsquo; near the foot of the
same eminence. But one of the most remarkable statements in her note is
the following:&mdash;&lsquo;Another singular coincidence may be traced
between the name of a brook in this neighbourhood, called Echel, and
the Echel For&#273;wyttw&#7931; who is recorded in the tale as having
been slain at this period of the chase.&rsquo; I have been unable to
discover any clue to a brook called Echel, but one called Egel occurs
in the right place; so I take it that Lady Charlotte Guest&rsquo;s
informants tacitly identified the name with that of Echel.
Substantially they were probably correct, as the Egel, called Ecel in
the dialect of the district, flows into the upper Clydach, which in its
turn falls into the Tawe near Pont ar Dawe. As the next pool mentioned
is &#7930;wch Tawe, I presume it was some water or other which drained
into the Tawe in this same neighbourhood. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb537" href="#v2pb537" name="v2pb537">537</a>]</span>The relative
positions of &#7930;wch Ewin, the Egel, and &#7930;wch Tawe as
indicated above offer no apparent difficulty. The Goidelic name
underlying that of Echel was probably some such a one as <i>Eccel</i>
or <i>Ecell</i>; and <i>Ecell</i> occurs, for instance, in the <i>Book
of the Dun Cow</i>, fo. 80<sup>b</sup>, as the name of a noble or
prince. In rendering this name into Welsh as <i>Echel</i>, due regard
was had for the etymological equivalence of Goidelic <i>cc</i> or
<i>c</i> to Welsh <i>ch</i>, but the unbroken oral tradition of a
people changing its language by degrees from Goidelic to Welsh was
subject to no such influence, especially in the matter of local names;
so the one here in question passed into Welsh as <i>Eccel</i>, liable
only to be modified into <i>Egel</i>. In any case, one may assume that
the death of the hero Echel was introduced to account for the name of
the brook Egel. Indications of something similar in the linguistic
sense occur in the part of the narrative relating the death of Grugyn,
at Garth Grugyn. This boar is pursued by two huntsmen called Eli and
Trachmyr, the name of the former of whom reminds one of Garth Eli, in
the parish of &#7930;an&#273;ewi Brefi. Possibly the original story
located at Garth Eli the death of Eli, or some other incident in which
Grugyn was concerned; but the difficulty here is that the exact
position of Garth Grugyn is still uncertain.</p>
<p>Lastly, our information as to the hunting of Twrch Trwyth is not
exclusively derived from the Kulhwch, for besides an extremely obscure
poem about the Twrch in the <i>Book of Aneurin</i>, a manuscript of the
thirteenth century, we have one item given in the <i>Mirabilia</i>
associated with the <i lang="la">Historia Brittonum</i> of Nennius,
&sect; 73, and this carries us back to the eighth century. It reads as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p><i lang="la">Est aliud mirabile in regione qu&aelig; dicitur Buelt.
Est ibi cumulus lapidum, et unus lapis superpositus super <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb538" href="#v2pb538" name=
"v2pb538">538</a>]</span>congestum, cum vestigio canis in eo. Quando
venatus est porcum Troit, impressit Cabal, qui erat canis Arthuri
militis, vestigium in lapide, et Arthur postea congregavit congestum
lapidum sub lapide in quo erat vestigium canis sui, et vocatur Carn
Cabal. Et veniunt homines et tollunt lapidem in manibus suis per
spacium diei et noctis, et in crastino die invenitur super congestum
suum.</i></p>
<p>&lsquo;Another wonder there is in the district called Bua&#7931;t:
there is there a heap of stones, and one stone is placed on the top of
the pile with the footmark of a dog in it. Cafa&#7931;, the dog of the
warrior Arthur, when chasing the pig Trwyd printed the mark of his foot
on it, and Arthur afterwards collected a heap of stones underneath the
stone in which was the footmark of his dog, and it is called
Cafa&#7931;&rsquo;s Cairn. And men come and take the stone away in
their hands for the space of a day and a night, and on the following
day the stone is found on the top of its heap<a class="noteref" id=

<p>Lady Charlotte Guest, in a note to the Kulhwch story in her
<i>Mabinogion</i>, ii. 360, appears to have been astonished to find
that <i>Carn Cava&#7931;</i>, as she writes it, was no fabulous mound
but an actual &lsquo;mountain in the district of Builth, to the south
of Rhayader Gwy, and within sight of that town.&rsquo; She went so far
as to persuade one of her friends to visit the summit, and he begins
his account of it to her with the words: &lsquo;Carn Cava&#7931;, or as
it is generally pronounced Corn Cava&#7931;, is a lofty and rugged
mountain.&rsquo; On one of the cairns on the mountain he discovered
what may have been the very stone to which the <i>Mirabilia</i> story
refers; but the sketch with which he accompanied his communication
cannot be said to be convincing, and he must have been drawing on his
imagination when he spoke of this somewhat <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb539" href="#v2pb539" name=
"v2pb539">539</a>]</span>high hill as a lofty mountain. Moreover his
account of its name only goes just far enough to be misleading: the
name as pronounced in the neighbourhood of Rhayader is <i>Corn
Gafa&#7931;t</i> by Welsh-speaking people, and <i>Corn Gavalt</i> by
monoglot Englishmen. So it is probable that at one time the
pronunciation was <i>Carn Gava&#7931;</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e18059src" href="#xd26e18059" name="xd26e18059src">56</a>. But to
return to the incident recorded by Nennius, one has to remark that it
does not occur in the Kulhwch; nor, seeing the position of the hill,
can it have been visited by Arthur or his dog in the course of the
Twrch Trwyth hunt as described by the redactor of the story in its
present form. This suggests the reflection not only that the Twrch
story is very old, but that it was put together by selecting certain
incidents out of an indefinite number, which, taken all together, would
probably have formed a network covering the whole of South Wales as far
north as the boundary of the portion of Mid-Wales occupied by the
Brythons before the Roman occupation. In other words, the Goidels of
this country had stories current among them to explain the names of the
places with which they were familiar; and it is known that was the case
with the Goidels of Ireland. Witness the place-name legends known in
Medieval Irish as <i>Dinds&#775;enchas</i>, with which the old
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb540" href="#v2pb540" name=
"v2pb540">540</a>]</span>literature of Ireland abounds. On what
principle the narrator of the Kulhwch made his selection from the
repertoire I cannot say; but one cannot help seeing that he takes
little interest in the details, and that he shows still less insight
into the etymological <i>motif</i> of the incidents which he mentions.
However, this should be laid mainly to the charge, perhaps, of the
early medieval redactor.</p>
<p>Among the reasons which have been suggested for the latter
overlooking and effacing the play on the place-names, I have hinted
that he did not always understand them, as they sometimes involved a
language which may not have been his. This raises the question of
translation: if the story was originally in Goidelic, what was the
process by which it passed into Brythonic? Two answers suggest
themselves, and the first comes to this: if the story was in writing,
we may suppose a literary man to have sat down to translate it word for
word from Goidelic to Brythonic, or else to adapt it in a looser
fashion. In either case, one should suppose him a master of both
languages, and capable of doing justice to the play on the place-names.
But it is readily conceivable that the fact of his understanding both
languages might lead him to miscalculate what was exactly necessary to
enable a monoglot Brython to grasp his meaning clearly. Moreover, if
the translator had ideas of his own as to style, he might object on
principle to anything like an explanation of words being interpolated
in the narrative. In short, one could see several loopholes through
which a little confusion might force itself in, and prevent the
monoglot reader or hearer of the translation from correctly grasping
the story at all points as it was in the original. The other view, and
the more natural one, as I think, is that we should postulate the
interference of no special translator, but suppose the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb541" href="#v2pb541" name=
"v2pb541">541</a>]</span>story, or rather a congeries of stories, to
have been current among the natives of a certain part of South Wales,
say the Loughor Valley, at a time when their language was still
Goidelic, and that, as they gradually gave up Goidelic and adopted
Brythonic, they retained their stories and translated the narrative,
while they did not always translate the place-names occurring in that
narrative. Thus, for instance, would arise the discrepancy between
<i>banw</i> and <i>Amanw</i>, the latter of which to be Welsh should
have been rendered <i>y Banw</i>, &lsquo;the Boar.&rsquo; If this is
approximately what took place, it is easy to conceive the possibility
of many points of nicety being completely effaced in the course of such
a rough process of transformation. In one or two small matters it
happens that we can contrast the community as translator with the
literary individual at work: I allude to the word <i>Trwyth</i>. That
vocable was not translated, not metaphoned, if I may so term it, at all
at the time: it passed, when it was still <i>Tr&#275;th-i</i>, from
Goidelic into Brythonic, and continued in use without a break; for the
changes whereby <i>Tr&#275;th-i</i> has become <i>Trwyth</i> have been
such as other words have undergone in the course of ages, as already
stated. On the other hand, the literary man who knew something of the
two languages seems to have reasoned, that where a Goidelic <i>th</i>
occurred between vowels, the correct etymological equivalent in
Brythonic was <i>t</i>, subject to be mutated to <i>d</i>. So when he
took the name over he metaphoned <i>Tr&#275;th-i</i> into
<i>Tr&#275;t-i</i>, whence we have the <i>Porcus Troit</i> of Nennius,
and <i>Twrch Trwyd</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e18193src" href=
"#xd26e18193" name="xd26e18193src">57</a> in Welsh poetry: these
<i>Troit</i> and <i>Trwyd</i> were the literary forms as contrasted
with the popular <i>Trwyth</i>. Now, if my surmises as to <i>Echel</i>
and <i>Egel</i> are near the truth, their history must be <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb542" href="#v2pb542" name=
"v2pb542">542</a>]</span>similar; that is to say, <i>Echel</i> would be
the literary form and <i>Ecel</i>, <i>Egel</i> the popular one
respectively of the Goidelic <i>Ecell</i>. A third parallel offers
itself in the case of the personal name <i>Arwyli</i>, borne by one of
Echel&rsquo;s companions: the <i>Arwyl</i> of that name has its
etymological equivalent in the <i>Arwystl-</i> of <i>Arwystli</i>, the
name of a district comprising the eastern slopes of Plinlimmon, and
represented now by the Deanery of Arwystli. So <i>Arwystli</i>
challenges comparison with the Irish <i>Airgialla</i> or
<i>Airg&eacute;ill</i>, anglicized <i>Oriel</i>, which denotes, roughly
speaking, the modern counties of Armagh, Louth, and Monaghan. For here
we have the same prefix <i>ar</i> placed in front of one and the same
vocable, which in Welsh is <i>gwystl</i>, &lsquo;a hostage,&rsquo; and
in Irish <i>giall</i>, of the same meaning and origin. The reader will
at once think of the same word in German as <i>geisel</i>, &lsquo;a
hostage,&rsquo; Old High German <i>g&#299;sal</i>. But the divergence
of sound between <i>Arwystl-i</i> and <i>Arwyl-i</i> arises out of the
difference of treatment of <i>sl</i> in Welsh and Irish. In the
Brythonic district of Mid-Wales we have <i>Arwystli</i> with <i>sl</i>
treated in the Brythonic way, while in <i>Arwyli</i> we have the
combination treated in the Goidelic way, the result being left standing
when the speakers of Goidelic in South Wales learnt Brythonic<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e18293src" href="#xd26e18293" name=
"xd26e18293src">58</a>.</p>
<p>Careful observation may be expected to add to the number of these
instructive instances. It is, however, not to be supposed that all
double forms of the names in these stories are to be explained in
exactly the same way. Thus, for instance, corresponding to Lug,
genitive Loga, we have the two forms &#7930;eu and &#7930;ew, of which
the former alone matches the Irish. But it is to be observed that
&#7930;eu remains in some verses<a class="noteref" id="xd26e18301src"
href="#xd26e18301" name="xd26e18301src">59</a> in the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb543" href="#v2pb543" name=
"v2pb543">543</a>]</span>story of Math, whereas in the prose he appears
to be called &#7930;ew. It is not improbable that the editing which
introduced &#7930;ew dates comparatively late, and that it was done by
a man who was not familiar with the Venedotian place-names of which
&#7930;eu formed part, namely, <i>Din&#7931;eu</i> and
<i>Nant&#7931;eu</i>, now <i>Din&#7931;e</i> and <i>Nant&#7931;e</i>.
Similarly the two brothers, Gofannon and Amaethon, as they are called
in the <i>Mabinogi</i> of Math and in the Kulhwch story, are found also
called Gofynyon and Amathaon. The former agrees with the Irish form
Goibniu, genitive Goibnenn, whereas Gofannon does not. As to Amaethon
or Amathaon the Irish counterpart has, unfortunately, not been
identified. Gofannon and Amaethon have the appearance of being
etymologically transparent in Welsh, and they have probably been
remodelled by the hand of a literary redactor. There were also two
forms of the name of Manawy&#273;an in Welsh; for by the side of that
there was another, namely, Manawydan, liable to be shortened to
Manawyd: both occur in old Welsh poetry<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e18325src" href="#xd26e18325" name="xd26e18325src">60</a>. But
<i>manawyd</i> or <i>mynawyd</i> is the Welsh word for an <i>awl</i>,
which is significant here, as the <i>Mabinogi</i> called after
Manawy&#273;an makes him become a shoemaker on two occasions, whence
the Triads style him one of the Three golden Shoemakers of the Isle of
Prydain: see the Oxford <i>Mabinogion</i>, p. 308.</p>
<p>What has happened in the way of linguistic change in one of our
stories, the Kulhwch, may have happened in others, say in the four
branches of the <i>Mabinogi</i>, namely, Pwy&#7931;, prince of Dyved;
Branwen, daughter of &#7930;yr; Math, son of Mathonwy; and
Manawy&#273;an, son of &#7930;yr. Some time ago I endeavoured to show
that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb544" href="#v2pb544" name=
"v2pb544">544</a>]</span>the principal characters in the
<i>Mabinogi</i> of Math, namely, the sons and daughters of D&ocirc;n,
are to be identified as a group with the Tuatha D&eacute; Danann,
&lsquo;Tribes of the Goddess Danu or Donu,&rsquo; of Irish legend. I
called attention to the identity of our Welsh D&ocirc;n with the Irish
Donu, genitive Donann, Gofynion or Gofannon with Goibniu, genitive
Goibnenn, and of &#7930;eu or &#7930;ew with Lug. Since then Professor
Zimmer has gone further, and suggested that the <i>Mabinogion</i> are
of Irish origin; but that I cannot quite admit. They are of Goidelic
origin, but they do not come from the Irish or the Goidels of Ireland:
they come rather, as I think, from this country&rsquo;s Goidels, who
never migrated to the sister island, but remained here eventually to
adopt Brythonic speech. There is no objection, however, so far as this
argument is concerned, to their being regarded as this country&rsquo;s
Goidels descended either from native Goidels or from early Goidelic
invaders from Ireland, or else partly from the one origin and partly
from the other. This last is perhaps the safest view to accept as a
working hypothesis. Now Professor Zimmer fixes on that of
<i>Mathonwy</i>, among other names, as probably the Welsh adaptation of
some such an Irish name as the genitive <i>Mathgamnai</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e18375src" href="#xd26e18375" name=
"xd26e18375src">61</a>, now anglicized <i>Mahony</i>. This I am also
prepared to accept in the sense that the Welsh form is a loan from a
Goidelic one current some time or other in this country, and
represented in Irish by <i>Mathgamnai</i>. The preservation of Goidelic
<i>th</i> in <i>Mathonwy</i> stamps it as ranking with <i>Trwyth</i>,
<i>Egel</i>, and <i>Arwyli</i>, as contrasted with a form
etymologically more correct, of which we seem to have an echo in the
Breton names <i>Madganoe</i> and <i>Madgone</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e18408src" href="#xd26e18408" name="xd26e18408src">62</a>.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb545" href="#v2pb545" name=
"v2pb545">545</a>]</span></p>
<p>Another name which I am inclined to regard as brought in from
Goidelic is that of Gilvaethwy, son of D&ocirc;n: it would seem to
involve some such a word as the Irish <i>gilla</i>, &lsquo;a youth, an
attendant or servant,&rsquo; and some form of the Goidelic name
<i>Maughteus</i> or <i>Mochta</i>, so that the name
<i>Gilla-mochtai</i> meant the attendant of Mochta. This last vocable
appears in Irish as the name of several saints, but previously it was
probably that of some pagan god of the Goidels, and its meaning was
most likely the same as that of the Irish participial <i>mochta</i>,
which Stokes explains as &lsquo;magnified, glorified&rsquo;: see his
<i>Calendar of Oengus</i>, p. ccxiv, and compare the name
<i>Mael-mochta</i>. Adamnan, in his <i lang="la">Vita S.
Columb&aelig;</i>, writes the name <i>Maucteus</i> in the following
passage, pref. ii. p. 6:&mdash;</p>
<p><i lang="la">Nam quidam proselytus Brito, homo sanctus, sancti
Patricii episcopi discipulus, Maucteus nomine, ita de nostro
prophetizavit Patrono, sicuti nobis ab antiquis traditum expertis
compertum habetur.</i></p>
<p>This saint, who is said to have prophesied of St. Columba and died
in the year 534, is described in his Life (Aug. 19) as <i lang=
"la">ortus ex Britannia</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e18454src" href=
"#xd26e18454" name="xd26e18454src">63</a>, which, coupled with
Adamnan&rsquo;s <i>Brito</i>, probably refers him to Wales; but it is
remarkable that nevertheless he bore the very un-Brythonic name of
<i>Mochta</i> or <i>Mauchta</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e18468src"
href="#xd26e18468" name="xd26e18468src">64</a>. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb546" href="#v2pb546" name=
"v2pb546">546</a>]</span></p>
<p>To return to the <i>Mabinogion</i>: I have long been inclined to
identify &#7930;wyd, son of Kilcoed, with the Irish Liath, son of
Celtchar, of Cualu in the present county of Wicklow. Liath, whose name
means &lsquo;grey,&rsquo; is described as the comeliest youth of noble
rank among the fairies of Erin; and the only time the Welsh &#7930;wyd,
whose name also means &lsquo;grey,&rsquo; appears in the
<i>Mabinogion</i> he is ascribed, not the comeliest figure, it is true,
or the greatest personal beauty, but the most imposing disguise of a
bishop attended by his suite: he was a great magician. The name of his
father, Kil-coet, seems to me merely an inexact popular rendering of
<i>Celtchar</i>, the name of Liath&rsquo;s father: at any rate one
fails here to detect the touch of the skilled translator or literary
redactor<span class="corr" id="xd26e18562" title=
"Not in source">.</span><a class="noteref" id="xd26e18564src" href=
"#xd26e18564" name="xd26e18564src">65</a> But the <i>Mabinogi</i> of
Manawy&#273;an, in which &#7930;wyd figures, is also the one in which
Pryderi king of Dyfed&rsquo;s wife is called <i>Kicua</i> or
<i>Cigfa</i>, a name which has no claim to be regarded as Brythonic. It
occurs early, however, in the legendary history of Ireland: the <i>Four
Masters</i>, under the year <span class="sc"><abbr title=
"Anno Mundi">A.M.</abbr></span> 2520, mention a Ciocbha as wife of a
son of Parthalon; and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb547" href=
"#v2pb547" name="v2pb547">547</a>]</span>the name seems to be related
to that of a man called <i>Cioccal</i>, <span class="sc"><abbr title=
"Anno Mundi">A.M.</abbr></span> 2530. Lastly, Manawy&#273;an, from whom
the <i>Mabinogi</i> takes its name, is called <i>mab &#7930;yr</i>,
&lsquo;son of &#7930;yr,&rsquo; in Welsh, and <i>Manann&aacute;n mac
Lir</i> in Irish. Similarly with his brother Br&acirc;n, and his sister
Branwen, except that she has not been identified in Irish story. But in
Irish literature the genitive <i>Lir</i>, as in <i>mac Lir</i>,
&lsquo;son of <i>Ler</i>,&rsquo; is so common, and the nominative so
rare, that <i>Lir</i> came to be treated in late Irish as the
nominative too; but a genitive of the form <i>Lir</i> suggests a
nominative-accusative <i>Ler</i>, and as a matter of fact it occurs,
for instance, in the couplet:&mdash;</p>

"xd26e18704src">67</a> is no other word than the Goidelic genitive
<i>Lir</i>, retained in use with its pronunciation modified according
to the habits of the Welsh language; and in that case<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e18757src" href="#xd26e18757" name="xd26e18757src">68</a> it
forms comprehensive evidence, that the stories about <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb548" href="#v2pb548" name=
"v2pb548">548</a>]</span>the &#7930;yr family in Welsh legend were
Goidelic before they put on a Brythonic garb.</p>
<p>As to the <i>Mabinogion</i> generally, one may say that they are
devoted to the fortunes chiefly of three powerful houses or groups, the
children of D&ocirc;n, the children of &#7930;yr, and
Pwy&#7931;&rsquo;s family. This last is brought into contact with the
&#7930;yr group, which takes practically the position of superiority.
Pwy&#7931;&rsquo;s family belonged chiefly to Dyfed; but the power and
influence of the sons of &#7930;yr had a far wider range: we find them
in Anglesey, at Harlech, in Gwales or the Isle of Grasholm off
Pembrokeshire, at Aber Henvelen somewhere south of the Severn Sea, and
in Ireland. But the expedition to Ireland under Br&acirc;n, usually
called <i>Bendigeituran</i>, &lsquo;Br&acirc;n<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e18795src" href="#xd26e18795" name="xd26e18795src">69</a> the
Blessed,&rsquo; proved so disastrous that the &#7930;yr group, as a
whole, disappears, making way for the children of D&ocirc;n. These last
came into collision with Pwy&#7931;&rsquo;s son, Pryderi, in whose
country Manawy&#273;an, son of &#7930;yr, had ended his days. Pryderi,
in consequence of Gwydion&rsquo;s deceit (pp. 69, 501, 525), makes war
on Math and the children of D&ocirc;n: he falls in it, and his army
gives hostages to Math. Thus after the disappearance of the sons of
&#7930;yr, the children of D&ocirc;n are found in power in their stead
in North Wales<a class="noteref" id="xd26e18810src" href="#xd26e18810"
name="xd26e18810src">70</a>, and that state of things corresponds
closely enough to the relation between the Tuatha D&eacute; Danann and
the Lir family in Irish legend. There Lir and his family are reckoned
in the number <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb549" href="#v2pb549"
name="v2pb549">549</a>]</span>of the Tuatha D&eacute; Danann, but
within that community Lir was so powerful that it was considered but
natural that he should resent a rival candidate being elected king in
preference to him. So the Tuatha D&eacute; took pains to conciliate
Lir, as did also their king, who gave his daughter to Lir to wife, and
when she died he gave him another of his daughters<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e18819src" href="#xd26e18819" name="xd26e18819src">71</a>; and
with the treatment of her stepchildren by that deceased wife&rsquo;s
sister begins one of the three Sorrowful Tales of Erin, known to
English readers as the Fate of the Children of Lir. But the reader
should observe the relative position: the Tuatha D&eacute; remain in
power, while the children of Lir belong to the past, which is also the
sequence in the <i>Mabinogion</i>. Possibly this is not to be
considered as having any significance, but it is to be borne in mind
that the Lir-&#7930;yr group is strikingly elemental in its patronymic
Lir, &#7930;yr. The nominative, as already stated, was <i>ler</i>,
&lsquo;sea,&rsquo; and so Cormac renders <i>mac Lir</i> by <i lang=
"la">filius maris</i>. How far we may venture to consider the sea to
have been personified in this context, and how early, it is impossible
to say. In any case it is deserving of notice that one group of Goidels
to this day do not say <i>mac Lir</i>, &lsquo;son of Lir,&rsquo;
<i lang="la">filium maris</i>, but always &lsquo;son of the
<i>lir</i>&rsquo;: I allude to the Gaels of the Isle of Man, in whose
language <i>Manann&aacute;n mac Lir</i> is always <i>Mannanan mac y
Lir</i>, or as they spell it, <i>Lear</i>; that is to say
&lsquo;Mannanan, son of the <i>ler</i>.&rsquo; Manxmen have been used
to consider Manannan their eponymous hero, and first king of their
island: they call him more familiarly <i>Mannanan beg mac y Lear</i>,
&lsquo;Little Mannanan, son of the <i>ler</i>&rsquo;. This we may,
though no Manxman of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb550" href=

meaning to the word <i>lir</i> or <i>lear</i>, <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e18874" title="Source: interpret">interpreted</span> as
&lsquo;Little Mannanan, son of the Sea.&rsquo; The wanderings at large
of the children of Lir before being eclipsed by the Danann-D&ocirc;n
group, remind one of the story of the labours of Hercules, where it
relates that hero&rsquo;s adventures on his return from robbing Geryon
of his cattle. Pomponius Mela, ii. 5 (p. 50), makes Hercules on that
journey fight in the neighbourhood of Aries with two sons of Poseidon
or Neptune, whom he calls (in the accusative) Albiona and Bergyon. To
us, with our more adequate knowledge of geography, the locality and the
men cannot appear the most congruous, but there can hardly be any
mistake as to the two personal names being echoes of those of Albion
and Iverion, Britain and Ireland.</p>
<p>The whole cycle of the <i>Mabinogion</i> must have appeared strange
to the story-teller and the poet of medieval Wales, and far removed
from the world in which they lived. We have possibly a trace of this
feeling in the epithet <i>h&ecirc;n</i>, &lsquo;old, ancient,&rsquo;
given to Math in a poem in the <i>Red Book of Hergest</i>, where we
meet with the line<a class="noteref" id="xd26e18889src" href=

which it would have interested us to find preserved. This state of
things brings back to my mind words of Matthew Arnold&rsquo;s, to which
I had the pleasure of listening more years ago than I care to remember.
He was lecturing at Oxford on Celtic literature, and observing
&lsquo;how evidently the medi&aelig;val story-teller is pillaging an
antiquity of which he does not fully possess the secret; he is like a
peasant,&rsquo; Matthew Arnold went on to say, &lsquo;building his hut
on the site of Halicarnassus or Ephesus; he builds, but what he builds
is full of materials of which he knows not the history, or knows by a
glimmering tradition merely&mdash;stones &ldquo;not of this
building,&rdquo; but of an older architecture, greater, cunninger, more
majestical. In the medi&aelig;val stories of no Latin or Teutonic
people does this strike one as in those of the Welsh.&rsquo; This
becomes intelligible only on the theory of the stories having been in
Goidelic before they put on a Welsh dress.</p>
<p>When saying that the <i>Mabinogion</i> and some of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb552" href="#v2pb552" name=
"v2pb552">552</a>]</span>stories contained in the Kulhwch, such as the
Hunting of Twrch Trwyth, were Goidelic before they became Brythonic, I
wish to be understood to use the word Goidelic in a qualified sense.
For till the Brythons came, the Goidels were, I take it, the ruling
race in most of the southern half of Britain, with the natives as their
subjects, except in so far as that statement has to be limited by the
fact, that we do not know how far they and the natives had been
amalgamating together. In any case, the hostile advent of another race,
the Brythons, would probably tend to hasten the process of
amalgamation. That being so, the stories which I have loosely called
Goidelic may have been largely aboriginal in point of origin, and by
that I mean native, pre-Celtic and non-Aryan. It comes to this, then:
we cannot say for certain whose creation Br&acirc;n, for instance,
should be considered to have been&mdash;that of Goidels or of non-Aryan
natives. He sat, as the <i>Mabinogi</i> of Branwen describes him, on
the rock of Harlech, a figure too colossal for any house to contain or
any ship to carry. This would seem to challenge comparison with
Cernunnos, the squatting god of ancient Gaul, around whom the other
gods appear as mere striplings, as proved by the monumental
representations in point. In these<a class="noteref" id="xd26e18975src"
href="#xd26e18975" name="xd26e18975src">74</a> he sometimes appears
antlered like a stag; sometimes he is provided either with three normal
heads or with one head furnished with three faces; and sometimes he is
reduced to a head provided with no body, which reminds one of
Br&acirc;n, who, when he had been rid of his body in consequence of a
poisoned wound inflicted on him in his foot in the slaughter of the
Meal-bag Pavilion, was reduced to the <i>Ur&#273;awl Ben</i>,
&lsquo;Venerable or Dignified <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb553"
href="#v2pb553" name="v2pb553">553</a>]</span>Head,&rsquo; mentioned in
the <i>Mabinogi</i> of Branwen<a class="noteref" id="xd26e18990src"
href="#xd26e18990" name="xd26e18990src">75</a>. The <i>Mabinogi</i>
goes on to relate how Br&acirc;n&rsquo;s companions began to enjoy,
subject to certain conditions, his &lsquo;Venerable Head&rsquo;s&rsquo;
society, which involved banquets of a fabulous duration and of a nature
not readily to be surpassed by those around the Holy Grail. In fact
here we have beyond all doubt one of the heathen originals of which the
Grail is a Christian version. But the multiplicity of faces or heads of
the Gaulish divinity find their analogues in a direction hitherto
unnoticed as far as I know, namely, among the Letto-Slavic peoples of
the Baltic sea-board. Thus the image of Svatovit in the island of
R&uuml;gen is said to have had four faces<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e19002src" href="#xd26e19002" name="xd26e19002src">76</a>; and the
life of Otto of Bamberg relates<a class="noteref" id="xd26e19008src"
href="#xd26e19008" name="xd26e19008src">77</a> how that high-handed
evangelist proceeded to convert the ancient Prussians to Christianity.
Among other things we are told how he found at Stettin an idol called
Triglaus, a word referring to the three heads for which the god was
remarkable. The saint took possession of the image and hewed away the
body, reserving for himself the three heads, which are represented
adhering together, forming one piece. This he sent as a trophy to Rome,
and in Rome it may be still. Were it perchance to be found, it might be
expected to show a close resemblance to the tricephal of the Gaulish
altar found at Beaune in Burgundy.</p>
<p>Before closing this chapter a word may be permitted as to the
Goidelic element in the history of Wales: it will come again before the
reader in a later chapter, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb554" href=
"#v2pb554" name="v2pb554">554</a>]</span>but what has already been
advanced or implied concerning it may here be recapitulated as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>It has been suggested that the hereditary dislike of the Brython for
the Goidel argues their having formerly lived in close proximity to one
another: see p. 473 above.</p>
<p>The tradition that the cave treasures of the Snowdon district belong
by right to the Goidels, means that they were formerly supposed to have
hidden them away when hard pressed by the Brythons: see pp. 471&ndash;2
above.</p>
<p>The sundry instances of a pair of names for a single person or
place, one Goidelic (Brythonicized) still in use, and the other
Brythonic (suggested by the Goidelic one), literary mostly and
obsolete, go to prove that the Goidels were not expelled, but allowed
to remain to adopt Brythonic speech.</p>
<p>Evidence of the indebtedness of story-tellers in Wales to their
brethren of the same profession in Ireland is comparatively scarce; and
almost in every instance of recent research establishing a connexion
between topics or incidents in the Arthurian romances and the native
literature of Ireland, the direct contact may be assumed to have been
with the folklore and legend of the Goidelic inhabitants of Wales,
whether before or after their change of language.</p>
<p>Probably the folklore and mythology of the Goidels of Wales and of
Ireland were in the mass much the same, though in some instances they
reach us in different stages of development: thus in such a case as
that of D&ocirc;n and Danu (genitive <i>Danann</i>) the Welsh allusions
in point refer to D&ocirc;n at a conspicuously earlier stage of her
r&ocirc;le than that represented by the Irish literature touching the
Tuatha D&eacute; Danann<a class="noteref" id="xd26e19033src" href=
"#xd26e19033" name="xd26e19033src">78</a>. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb555" href="#v2pb555" name=
"v2pb555">555</a>]</span></p>
<p>The common point of view from which our ancestors liked to look at
the scenery around them is well illustrated by the fondness of the
Goidel, in Wales and Ireland alike, for incidents to explain his
place-names. He required the topography&mdash;indeed he requires it
still, and hence the activity of the local etymologist&mdash;to connote
story or history: he must have something that will impart the cold
light of physical nature, river and lake, moor and mountain, a warmer
tint, a dash of the pathetic element, a touch of the human, borrowed
from the light and shade of the world of imagination and fancy in which
he lives and dreams. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb556" href=

<i>Mergaed</i> for <i>Mengwaed</i> hardly requires any explanation; and
as to <i>Breat</i> or rather <i>Vreat</i>, as it occurs in mutation, we

considered: J. D. Rhys, the grammarian (p. 22 above), gives in the
Peniarth MS. 118 a list of <i>caers</i> or castles called after giants,
and among them is that of Grugyn in the parish, he says, of

the MS. is said to be at the Bodleian, though I have not succeeded in
tracing it. But Jones gives <i>Villa de Ystraddewi</i>, and speaks of a
chapel of St. John&rsquo;s of <i>Stradtewi</i>, which must have been
St. John&rsquo;s Church, at Tretower, one of the ecclesiastical
districts of Cwm Du: see also p. 497. The name is probably to be

river may in Welsh be briefly called after anybody or anything. Thus in
North Cardiganshire there is a stream called <i>Einon</i>, that is to
say &lsquo;Einion&rsquo;s river,&rsquo; and the flat land on both sides
of it is called <i>Ystrad Einon</i>, which looks as if one might
translate it Einion&rsquo;s Strath, but it means the Strath of
Einion&rsquo;s river, or of the stream called Einon, as one will at
once see from the upper course of the water being called <i>Blaen
Einon</i>, which can only mean the upper course of the Einon river. So
here <i>yw</i> is in English &lsquo;yew,&rsquo; but <i>Ystrad Yw</i>
and <i>&#7930;ygad Yw</i> have to be rendered the Strath of the Yew
burn and the Eye of the Yew burn respectively. It is moreover felt by
the Welsh-speaking people of the district that <i>yw</i> is the plural
of <i>ywen</i>, &lsquo;a single yew,&rsquo; and as there is only one
yew at the source somebody had the brilliant idea of making the name
right by calling it <i>Ywen</i>, and this has got into the maps as
<i>Ewyn</i>, as though it were the Welsh word for foam. Who began it I
cannot say, but Theophilus Jones has it in his <i>History of the County
of Brecknock</i>, published in 1809. Nevertheless the name is still
<i>Yw</i>, not <i>Ywen</i> or <i>Ewyn</i>, in the Welsh of the
district, though Lewis gives it as <i>Ywen</i> in his article on

account of the position &lsquo;of the spring emanating under the but of
the yew tree,&rsquo; and partly because there is only a single yew
there. Theophilus Jones complained a century ago that the Gaer in
Ystrad Yw had not attracted the attention it deserved; and I have been
greatly disappointed to find that the Cambrian Arch&aelig;ological

Arthur himself in the Life of Gruffy&#273; ab Cynan, as the equivalent
probably of the Latin <i>Arthur Miles</i> (p. 538 below): see the
<i>Myvyrian Archaiology</i>, ii. 590. Similarly the soldiers or
champions of Christ are called <i>rys&#7933;yr crist</i> in the Welsh
Life of St. David: see the <i>Elucidarium and other Tracts</i> (in the

<i>Rudvyw Rys</i> would be in Modern Welsh <i>Rhu&#273;fyw Rys</i>, and
probably means Rhu&#273;fyw the Champion or Fighter, as <i>Rhys</i> is
likely to have been synonymous with <i>rhyswr</i>. The corresponding
Irish name was <i>Russ</i> or <i>Ross</i>, genitive <i>Rossa</i>, and
it appears to come from the same origin as Irish <i>ross</i>, &lsquo;a
headland, a forest,&rsquo; Welsh <i>rhos</i>, &lsquo;moorland,
uncultivated ground.&rsquo; The original meaning was presumably
&lsquo;exposed or open and untilled land&rsquo;; and Stokes supposes
the word to stand for an early <i>(p)ro-sto-</i> with <i>sto</i> of the
same origin as Latin <i>sto</i>, &lsquo;I stand,&rsquo; and as the
English word <i>stand</i> itself. In that case <i>Ros</i>, genitive
<i>Rossa</i>, Welsh <i>Rhys</i>, would mean one who stands out to
fight, a <span class="trans" title="prostat&#275;s"><span class="Greek"
lang=
"grc">&pi;&rho;&omicron;&sigma;&tau;&#8049;&tau;&eta;&sigmaf;</span></span>,
so to say. But not only are these words of a different declension
implying a nominative <i>Ro-stus</i>, but the Welsh one must have been
once accented <i>Ro-st&uacute;s</i> on the ending which is now lost,
otherwise there is no accounting for the change of the remaining vowel
into <i>y</i>. Other instances postulating an early Welsh accentuation
of the same kind are very probably <i>&#7931;yg</i>, &lsquo;a
fieldmouse,&rsquo; Irish <i>luch</i>, &lsquo;a mouse&rsquo;;
<i>pryd</i>, &lsquo;form,&rsquo; Irish <i>cruth</i>; <i lang=
"cy">pryf</i>, &lsquo;<span class="corr" id="xd26e17549" title=
"Source: aworm">a worm</span>,&rsquo; Irish <i>cruim</i>; so also with
<i>ych</i>, &lsquo;an ox,&rsquo; and <i>nyth</i>, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb531n" href="#v2pb531n" name=
"v2pb531n">531</a>]</span>&lsquo;a nest,&rsquo; Irish <i>nett</i>,
genitive <i>nitt</i>, derived by Stokes from <i>nizdo-</i>, which,
however, must have been oxytone, like the corresponding Sanskrit
<i>n&#299;dh&aacute;</i>. There is one very interesting compound of
<i>rhys</i>, namely the saint&rsquo;s name <i>Rhwydrys</i>, as it were
<i>R&#275;do-rostus</i> to be compared with Gaulish
<i>Epor&#275;do-r&#299;x</i>, which is found in Irish analysed into
<i>r&iacute; Eochraidhi</i>, designating the fairy king who was father
to &Eacute;t&aacute;in: see Windisch&rsquo;s <i>Irische Texte</i>, p.
119. <i>Bledrws</i>, <i>Bledrus</i>, as contrasted with <i>Bledrys</i>,
<i>Bledris</i>, postulate Goidelic accentuation, while one has to treat
<i>Bledruis</i> as a compromise between <i>Bledrws</i> and
<i>Bledris</i>, unless it be due to misreading a <i>Bledruif</i>
(<i>Book of &#7930;an D&acirc;v</i>, pp. 185, 221&ndash;2, and <i>Arch.
Camb.</i> for 1875, p. 370). The Goidelic accent at an early date moved
to first syllables, hence <i>cruth</i> (with its vowel influenced by
the <i>u&#815;</i> of a stem <i>qu&#815;r&#805;t</i>) under the stress
accent, became, when unstressed, <i>cridh</i> (from a simplified stem

There are two other inscriptions in South Wales which contain the name
Paulinus, one on a stone found in the neighbourhood of Port Talbot in
Glamorgan, reading <i lang="la">Hic iacit Cantusus Pater Paulinus</i>,
which seems to imply that Paulinus set up the stone to the memory of a
son of his named Cantusus. The other, found on the site of the extinct

softening of <i>Cafa&#7931;</i> to <i>Gafa&#7931;</i> could not take
place after the masculine <i>corn</i>, &lsquo;a horn&rsquo;; but it was
just right after the feminine <i>carn</i>, &lsquo;a cairn.&rsquo; So
here <i>corn</i> is doubtless a colloquial corruption; and so is
probably the <i>t</i> at the end, for as <i>&#7931;t</i> has frequently
been reduced to <i>&#7931;</i>, as in <i>cyfai&#7931;</i>, &lsquo;a
friend,&rsquo; from the older <i>cyfai&#7931;t</i>, in Medieval Irish
<i>comalta</i>, &lsquo;a foster brother or sister,&rsquo; the language
has sometimes reversed the process, as when one hears <i>ho&#7931;t</i>
for <i>ho&#7931;</i>, &lsquo;all,&rsquo; or reads <i>ffery&#7931;t</i>,
&lsquo;alchemist, chemist,&rsquo; for <i>ffery&#7931;</i> from
<i>Vergilius</i>. The Nennian orthography does not much trouble itself
to distinguish between <i>l</i> and <i>&#7931;</i>, and even when
<i>Carn Cabal</i> was written the pronunciation was probably <i>Carn
Gava&#7931;</i>, the mutation being ignored in the spelling, which
frequently happens in the case even of Welsh people who never fail to
mutate their consonants in speaking. Lastly, though it was a dog that
was called <i>Cafa&#7931;</i>, it is remarkable that the word has
exactly the form taken by <i>caballus</i> in Welsh: for
<i>cafa&#7931;</i>, as meaning some sort of a horse, see Silvan

possibly one might mention likewise <i>Gilmin Troetu</i> or
<i>Troed&#273;u</i>, &lsquo;Gilmin of the Black Foot,&rsquo; the
legendary ancestor (p. 444) of the Wynns of Glyn &#7930;ifon, in
Carnarvonshire. So the name might be a shortening of some such a
combination as <i>Gilla-min</i>, &lsquo;the attendant of <i>Min</i> or
<i>Men</i>,&rsquo; a name we have also in <i>Mocu-Min</i>,
&lsquo;Min&rsquo;s Kin,&rsquo; a family or sept so called more than
once by Adamnan. Perhaps one would also be right in regarding as of
similar origin the name of Gilberd or Gilbert, son of Cadgyffro, who is
mentioned in the Kulhwch, and in the <i>Black Book</i>, fo.
14<sup>b</sup>: at any rate I am not convinced that the name is to be
identified with the Gillebert of the Normans, unless that was itself
derived from Celtic. But there is a discrepancy between <i>Gilmin</i>,
<i>Gilbert</i>, with unmutated <i>m</i> and <i>b</i>, and
<i>Gilvaethwy</i> with its mutation consonant <i>v</i>. In all three,
however, <i>Gil</i>, had it been Welsh, would <span class=

as indicated by the name <i>Gi&#7931;a</i> in the Kulhwch (Oxford
<i>Mabinogion</i>, p. 110), in which we seem to have the later form of
the old name <i>Gildas</i>. Compare such Irish instances as
<i>Fiachna</i> and <i>Cera</i>, which seem to imply stems originally
ending in <i>-asa-s</i> (masculine) and <i>-as&#257;</i> (feminine);

meant &lsquo;him who is fond of concealment.&rsquo; The <i>Mabinogi</i>
form of the Welsh name is <i lang="cy">&#7930;wyt uab kil coet</i>,
which literally meant &lsquo;&#7930;. son of (him of) the Retreat of

of Celtchar at the same time that he rendered <i>celt</i> by

There has been a good deal of confusion as to the name &#7930;yr: thus
for instance, the Welsh translations of Geoffrey of Monmouth make the
<i>Leir</i> of his Latin into <i>&#7930;yr</i>, and the personage
intended is represented as the father of three daughters named
Gonerilla, Regan, and Cordeilla or Cordelia. But Cordelia is probably
the Creur&#273;ilad of the <i>Black Book</i>, p. 49<sup>b</sup>, and
the Crei&#273;ylat of the Kulhwch story (the Oxford <i>Mabinogion</i>,
pp. 113, 134), and her father was &#7930;&ucirc;d &#7930;awereint (=
Irish Nuada Airgetl&aacute;m) and not &#7930;yr. Then as to the
<i>Leir</i> of Geoffrey&rsquo;s Latin, that name looks as if given its
form on the strength of the <i>legr-</i> of <i>Legraceaster</i>, the
Anglo-Saxon name of the town now called Leicester, of which William of
Malmesbury (<i lang="la">Gesta Pontificum</i>, &sect; 176) says,
<i lang="la">Legrecestra est civitas antiqua in Mediterraneis Anglis, a
Legra fluvio pr&aelig;terfluente sic vocata</i>. Mr. Stevenson regards
<i>Legra</i> as an old name of the Soar, and as surviving in that of
the village of Leire, spelled <i>Legre</i> in Domesday. It seems to
point back to a <i>Legere</i> or <i>Ligere</i>, which recalls
<i>Liger</i>, &lsquo;the Loire.&rsquo;&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

say <i>in that case</i>, as this is not quite conclusive; for Welsh has
an appellative <i>&#7931;yr</i>, &lsquo;mare, &aelig;quor,&rsquo; which
may be a generalizing of <i>&#7930;yr</i>; or else it may represent an
early <i>lerio-s</i> from <i>lero-s</i> (see p. 549 below), and our
<i>&#7930;yr</i> may possibly be this and not the Irish genitive
<i>Lir</i> retained as <i>&#7930;yr</i>. That, however, seems to me
improbable on the whole.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

it is relevant to direct the reader&rsquo;s attention to Nutt&rsquo;s
<i>Legend of the Holy Grail</i>, p. 28, where, in giving an abstract of
the <i lang="fr">Petit saint Graal</i>, he speaks of the Br&acirc;n of
that romance, in French <i>Bron</i>, nominative <i>Brons</i>, as having
the keeping of the Grail and dwelling &lsquo;in these isles of

D&ocirc;n and &#7930;yr groups are not brought into conflict or even
placed in contact with one another; and the reason seems to be that the
story-teller wanted to introduce the sons of Beli as supreme in Britain
after the death of Br&acirc;n. Beli and his sons are also represented
in Maxen&rsquo;s Dream as ruling over Britain when the Roman conqueror
arrives. What is to be made of Beli may be learnt from <i>The Welsh

These things one learns about Lir from the story mentioned in the text

Skene&rsquo;s <i>Four Ancient Books of Wales</i>, ii. 303, also
108&ndash;9, where the fragment of the poem as given in the <i>Book of
Taliessin</i> is printed. The line here quoted has been rendered in
vol. i. 286, &lsquo;With Matheu and Govannon,&rsquo; which places the
old pagan Gofannon in rather unexpected company. A few lines later in
the poem mention is made of a <i>Kaer Gofannon</i>: where was that?
Skene, in a note on it (ii. 452), says that &lsquo;In an old list of
the churches of Linlithgow, printed by Theiner, appears <i>Vicaria de
Gumanyn</i>. The place meant is probably Dalmeny, on the Firth of
Forth, formerly called Dumanyn.&rsquo; This is interesting only as
showing that <i>Gumanyn</i> is probably to be construed <i>Dumanyn</i>,
and that <i>Dalmeny</i> represents an ancient <i>D&uacute;n Manann</i>
in a neighbourhood where one already has <i>Clach Manann</i>,
&lsquo;the stone of Manau,&rsquo; and <i>Sliabh Manann</i>,
&lsquo;Mountain of Manau&rsquo; now respectively Clackmannan and

<p class="first">The attitude of the Kymry towards folklore and popular
superstitions varies according to their training and religious views;
and I distinguish two classes of them in this respect. First of all,
there are those who appear to regret the ebb of the tide of ancient
beliefs. They maintain that people must have been far more interesting
when they believed in the fairies; and they rave against Sunday schools
and all other schools for having undermined the ancient superstitions
of the peasantry: it all comes, they say, of over-educating the working
classes. Of course one may occasionally wish servant maids still
believed that they might get presents from the fairies for being neat
and tidy; and that, in the contrary case of their being sluts, they
would be pinched black and blue during their sleep by the little
people: there may have been some utility in beliefs of that kind. But,
if one takes an impartial view of the surroundings in which this kind
of mental condition was possible, no sane man could say that the
superstitious beliefs of our ancestors conduced on the whole to their
happiness. Fancy a state of mind in which this sort of thing is
possible:&mdash;A member of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb557"
href="#v2pb557" name="v2pb557">557</a>]</span>the family is absent, let
us say, from home in the evening an hour later than usual, and the
whole household is thrown into a panic because they imagine that he has
strayed on fairy ground, and has been spirited away to the land of
fairy twilight, whence he may never return; or at any rate only to
visit his home years, or maybe ages, afterwards, and then only to fall
into a heap of dust just as he has found out that nobody expects or
even knows him. Or take another instance:&mdash;A man sets out in the
morning on an important journey, but he happens to sneeze, or he sees
an ill-omened bird, or some other dreaded creature, crossing his path:
he expects nothing that day but misfortune, and the feeling of alarm
possibly makes him turn back home, allowing the object of his journey
to be sacrificed. That was not a satisfactory state of things or a
happy one, and the unhappiness might be wholly produced by causes over
which the patient had absolutely no control, so long at any rate as the
birds of the air have wings, and so long as sneezing does not belong to
the category of voluntary actions. Then I might point to the terrors of
magic; but I take it to be unnecessary to dwell on such things, as most
people have heard about them or read of them in books. On the whole it
is but charitable to suppose that those who regret the passing away of
the ages of belief and credulity have not seriously attempted to
analyse the notions which they are pleased to cherish.</p>
<p>Now, as to the other class of people, namely, those who object to
folklore in every shape and form, they may be roughly distinguished
into different groups, such as those to whom folklore is an
abomination, because they hold that it is opposed to the Bible, and
those who regard it as too trivial to demand the attention of any
serious person. I have no occasion for <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb558" href="#v2pb558" name="v2pb558">558</a>]</span>many words with
the former, since nearly everything that is harmful in popular
superstition has ceased in Wales to be a living force influencing
one&rsquo;s conduct; or if this be not already the case, it is fast
becoming so. Those therefore who condemn superstitions have really no
reason to set their faces against the student of folklore: it would be
just as if historians were to be boycotted because they have, in
writing history&mdash;frequently, the more the pity&mdash;to deal with
dark intrigues, cruel murders, and sanguinary wars. Besides, those who
study folklore do not thereby help to strengthen the hold of
superstition on the people. I have noticed that any local peculiarity
of fashion, the moment it becomes known to attract the attention of
strangers, is, one may say, doomed: a Celt, like anybody else, does not
like to be photographed in a light which may perchance show him at a
disadvantage. It is much the same, I think, with him as the subject of
the studies of the folklorist: hence the latter has to proceed with his
work very quietly and very warily. If, then, I pretended to be a
folklorist, which I can hardly claim to be, I should say that I had
absolutely no quarrel with him who condemns superstition on principle.
On the other hand, I should not consider it fair of him to regard me as
opposed to the progress of the race in happiness and civilization, just
because I am curious to understand its history.</p>
<p>With regard to him, however, who looks at the collecting and the
studying of folklore as trivial work and a waste of time, I should
gather that he regards it so on account, first perhaps, of his
forgetting the reality their superstitions were to those who believed
in them; and secondly, on account of his ignorance of their meaning. As
a reality to those who believed in them, the superstitions of our
ancestors form an <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb559" href=
"#v2pb559" name="v2pb559">559</a>]</span>integral part of their
history. However, I need not follow that topic further by trying to
show how &lsquo;the proper study of mankind is man,&rsquo; and how it
is a mark of an uncultured people not to know or care to know about the
history of the race. So the ancient Roman historian, Tacitus, evidently
thought; for, when complaining how little was known as to the original
peopling of Britain, he adds the suggestive words <i lang="la">ut inter
barbaros</i>, &lsquo;as usual among barbarians.&rsquo; Conversely, I
take it for granted that no liberally educated man or woman of the
present day requires to be instructed as to the value of the study of
history in all its aspects, or to be told that folklore cannot be
justly called trivial, seeing that it has to do with the history of the
race&mdash;in a wider sense, I may say with the history of the human
mind and the record of its development.</p>
<p>As history has been mentioned, it may be here pointed out that one
of the greatest of the folklorist&rsquo;s difficulties is that of
drawing the line between story and history. Nor is that the worst of
it; for the question as between fact and fiction, hard as it is in
itself, is apt to be further complicated by questions of ethnology.
This may be illustrated by reference to a group of legends which
project a vanishing distinction between the two kindred races of
Brythons and Goidels in Wales; and into the story of some of them
Arthur is introduced playing a principal r&ocirc;le. They seem to point
to a time when the Goidels had as yet wholly lost neither their own
language nor their own institutions in North Wales: for the legends
belong chiefly to Gwyne&#273;, and cluster especially around Snowdon,
where the characteristics of the Goidel as the earlier Celt may well
have lingered latest, thanks to the comparatively inaccessible nature
of the country. One of these legends has already been summarized as
representing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb560" href="#v2pb560"
name="v2pb560">560</a>]</span>Arthur marching up the side of Snowdon
towards Bwlch y Saethau, where he falls and is buried under a cairn
named from him <i>Carne&#273; Arthur</i>: see p. 473. We are not told
who his enemies were; but with this question has usually been
associated the late Triad, iii. 20, which alludes to Arthur meeting in
Nanhwynain with Medrawd or Medrod (Modred) and I&#273;awc Corn Prydain,
and to his being betrayed, for the benefit and security of the Saxons
in the island. An earlier reference to the same story occurs in the
Dream of Rhonabwy in the <i>Red Book of Hergest</i><a class="noteref"
id="xd26e19087src" href="#xd26e19087" name="xd26e19087src">1</a>, in
which I&#273;awc describes himself as I&#273;awc son of Mynio, and as
nicknamed <i>I&#273;awc Cor&#273; Prydain</i>&mdash;which means
&lsquo;I&#273;awc the Churn-staff of Prydain&rsquo;&mdash;in reference
presumably to his activity in creating dissension. He confesses to
having falsified the friendly messages of Arthur to Medrod, and to
succeeding thereby in bringing on the fatal battle of Camlan, from
which I&#273;awc himself escaped to do penance for seven years on the
<i>&#7930;ech Las</i>, &lsquo;Grey Stone<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e19103src" href="#xd26e19103" name="xd26e19103src">2</a>,&rsquo;
in Prydain or Pictland.</p>
<p>Another story brings Arthur and the giant Rhita into collision, the
latter of whom has already been mentioned as having, according to local
tradition, his grave on the top of Snowdon: see pp. 474&ndash;9. The
story is a very wild one. Two kings who were brothers, Nyniaw or Nynio
and Peibiaw or Peibio, quarrelled thus: one moonlight night, as they
were together in the open air, Nynio said to Peibio, &lsquo;See, what a
fine extensive field I possess.&rsquo; &lsquo;Where is it?&rsquo; asked
Peibio. &lsquo;There it is,&rsquo; said Nynio, &lsquo;the whole
firmament.&rsquo; &lsquo;See,&rsquo; said Peibio, &lsquo;what
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb561" href="#v2pb561" name=
"v2pb561">561</a>]</span>innumerable herds of cattle and sheep I have
grazing in thy field.&rsquo; &lsquo;Where are they?&rsquo; asked Nynio.
&lsquo;There they are,&rsquo; said Peibio, &lsquo;the whole host of
stars that thou seest, each of golden brightness, with the moon
shepherding them.&rsquo; &lsquo;They shall not graze in my
field,&rsquo; said Nynio. &lsquo;But they shall,&rsquo; said Peibio;
and the two kings got so enraged with one another, that they began a
war in which their warriors and subjects were nearly exterminated. Then
comes Rhita Gawr, king of Wales, and attacks them on the dangerous
ground of their being mad. He conquered them and shaved off their
beards<a class="noteref" id="xd26e19119src" href="#xd26e19119" name=
"xd26e19119src">3</a>; but when the other kings of Prydain,
twenty-eight in number, heard of it, they collected all their armies
together to avenge themselves on Rhita for the disgrace to which he had
subjected the other two. But after a great struggle Rhita conquers
again, and has the beards of the other kings shaved. Then the kings of
neighbouring kingdoms in all directions combined to make war on Rhita
to avenge the disgrace to their order; but they were also vanquished
forthwith, and treated in the same ignominious fashion as the thirty
kings of Prydain. With the beards he had a mantle made to cover him
from head to foot, and that was a good deal, we are told, since he was
as big as two ordinary men. Then Rhita turned his attention to the
establishment of just and equitable laws as between king and king and
one realm with another<a class="noteref" id="xd26e19131src" href=
"#xd26e19131" name="xd26e19131src">4</a>. But the sequel <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb562" href="#v2pb562" name=
"v2pb562">562</a>]</span>to the shaving is related by Geoffrey of
Monmouth, x. 3, where Arthur is made to tell how the giant, after
destroying the other kings and using their beards in the way mentioned,
asked him for his beard to fix above the other beards, as he stood
above them in rank, or else to come and fight a duel with him. Arthur,
as might be expected, chose the latter course, with the result that he
slew Rhita, there called <i>Ritho</i>, at a place said to be <i>in
Aravio Monte</i>, by which the Welsh translator understood the chief
mountain of <i>Eryri</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e19154src" href=
"#xd26e19154" name="xd26e19154src">5</a> or Snowdon. So it is but
natural that his grave should also be there, as already mentioned. I
may here add that it is the name Snowdon itself, probably, that
underlies the <i>Senaudon</i> or <i>Sinadoun</i> of such Arthurian
romances as the English version of <i lang="la">Libeaus Desconus</i>,
though the place meant has been variously supposed to be situated
elsewhere than in the Snowdon district: witness <i>Sinodun</i> Hill in
Berkshire<a class="noteref" id="xd26e19173src" href="#xd26e19173" name=
"xd26e19173src">6</a>.</p>
<p>The story of Rhita is told also by Malory, who calls that giant
<i>Ryons</i> and <i>Ryence</i>; and there the incident seems to end
with Ryons being led to Arthur&rsquo;s court by knights who had
overcome him. Ryons&rsquo; challenge, as given by Malory<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e19190src" href="#xd26e19190" name=
"xd26e19190src">7</a>, runs thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This meane whyle came a messager from kynge Ryons of
Northwalys. And kynge he was of all Ireland and of many Iles. And this
was his message gretynge wel kynge Arthur in this manere wyse sayenge .

lacked one place of the mantel . wherfor he sente for his berd or els
he wold entre in to his landes . and brenne and slee . &amp; neuer leue
tyl he haue the hede and the berd.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rhita is not said, it is true, to have been a <i>Gwy&#273;el</i>,
&lsquo;Goidel&rsquo;; but he is represented ruling over Ireland, and
his name, which is not Welsh, recalls at first sight those of such men
as <i>Boya</i> the Pict or Scot figuring in the life of St. David, and
such as <i>&#7930;ia Gvitel</i>, &lsquo;&#7930;ia the Goidel,&rsquo;
mentioned in the Stanzas of the Graves in the <i>Black Book of
Carmarthen</i> as buried in the seclusion of Ardudwy<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e19214src" href="#xd26e19214" name="xd26e19214src">8</a>.
Malory&rsquo;s <i>Ryons</i> is derived from the French Romances, where,
as for example in the <i>Merlin</i>, according to the Huth MS., it
occurs as <i>Rion-s</i> in the nominative, and <i>Rion</i> in
r&eacute;gime. The latter, owing to the old French habit of eliding
<i>&#273;</i> or <i>th</i>, derives regularly enough from such a form
as the accusative <i>Rithon-em</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e19248src"
href="#xd26e19248" name="xd26e19248src">9</a>, which is the one
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb564" href="#v2pb564" name=
"v2pb564">564</a>]</span>occurring in Geoffrey&rsquo;s text; and we
should probably be right in concluding therefrom that the correct old
Welsh form of the name was <i>Rithon</i>. But the Goidelic form was at
the same time probably <i>Ritta</i>, with a genitive <i>Rittann</i>,
for an earlier <i>Ritton</i>. Lastly, that the local legend should
perpetuate the Goidelic <i>Ritta</i> slightly modified, has its
parallel in the case of <i>Trwyd</i> and <i>Trwyth</i>, and of
<i>Echel</i> and <i>Egel</i> or <i>Ecel</i>, pp. 541&ndash;2 and
536&ndash;7.</p>
<p>The next story<a class="noteref" id="xd26e19338src" href=
"#xd26e19338" name="xd26e19338src">10</a> points to a spot between <i>y
Dinas</i> or <i>Dinas Emrys</i> and <i lang="cy">&#7930;yn y Dinas</i>
as containing the grave of <i>Owen y Mhacsen</i>, that is to say,
&lsquo;Owen son of Maxen.&rsquo; Owen had been fighting with a
giant&mdash;whose name local tradition takes for granted&mdash;with
balls of steel; and there are depressions (<i>panylau</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e19359src" href="#xd26e19359" name=
"xd26e19359src">11</a>) still to be seen in the ground where each of
the combatants took his stand. Some, however, will have it that it was
with bows and arrows they fought, and that the hollows are the places
they dug to defend themselves. The result was that both died at the
close of the conflict; and Owen, being asked where he wished to be
buried, ordered an arrow to be shot into the air and his grave to be
made where it fell. The story is similarly given in the <i>Iolo
MSS.</i>, pp. 81&ndash;2, where the combatants are called <i>Owen
Fin&#273;u ab Macsen Wledig</i>, &lsquo;Owen of the Dark Face, son of
Prince Maxen,&rsquo; and <i>Eurnach Hen</i>, &lsquo;E. the
Ancient,&rsquo; one of the <i>Gwy&#273;yl</i> or &lsquo;Goidels&rsquo;
of North Wales, and otherwise called <i>Urnach Wy&#273;el</i>. He is
there represented as father (1) of the Serrigi defeated by
<i>Catwa&#7931;awn</i> or <i>Cadwa&#7931;on Law-hir</i>, &lsquo;C. the
Long-handed,&rsquo; at <i>Cerrig y Gwy&#273;yl</i>, &lsquo;the Stones
of the Goidels,&rsquo; near Ma&#7931;draeth<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e19390src" href="#xd26e19390" name="xd26e19390src">12</a>, in
Anglesey, where the great and final rout of the Goidels is represented
as having <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb565" href="#v2pb565" name=
"v2pb565">565</a>]</span>taken place<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e19405src" href="#xd26e19405" name="xd26e19405src">13</a>; (2) of
Daronwy, an infant spared and brought up in Anglesey to its detriment,
as related in the other story, p. 504; and (3) of Solor, who commands
one of the three cruising fleets of the Isle of Prydain<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e19411src" href="#xd26e19411" name=
"xd26e19411src">14</a>. The stronghold of Eurnach or Urnach is said to
have been Dinas Ffaraon, which was afterwards called <i>Din Emreis</i>
and <i>Dinas Emrys</i>. The whole story about the Goidels in North
Wales, however, as given in the <i>Iolo MSS.</i>, pp. 78&ndash;80, is a
hopeless jumble, though it is probably based on old traditions. In
fact, one detects Eurnach or Urnach as Wrnach or Gwrnach in the story
of Kulhwch and Olwen<a class="noteref" id="xd26e19435src" href=
"#xd26e19435" name="xd26e19435src">15</a> in the <i>Red Book</i>, where
we are told that Kei or Cai, and others of Arthur&rsquo;s men, got into
the giant&rsquo;s castle and cut off his head in order to secure his
sword, which was one of the things required for the hunting of Twrch
Trwyth. In an obscure passage, also in a poem in the <i>Black Book</i>,
we read of Cai fighting in the hall of this giant, who is then called
Awarnach<a class="noteref" id="xd26e19448src" href="#xd26e19448" name=
"xd26e19448src">16</a>. Some such a feat appears to have been
commemorated in the place-name <i>Gwryd Cai</i>, &lsquo;Cai&rsquo;s
Feat of Arms,&rsquo; which occurs in &#7930;ewelyn&rsquo;s grant of
certain lands on the Be&#273;gelert and Pen Gwryd side of Snowdon in
1198 to the monks of Aberconwy, or rather in an <i lang=
"la">inspeximus</i> of the same: see Dugdale&rsquo;s <i>Monasticon</i>,
v. 673<sup>a</sup>, where it stands printed <i>gwryt, kei</i>. Nor is
it unreasonable to guess that <i>Pen Gwryd</i> is only a shortening of
<i>Pen Gwryd Cai</i>, &lsquo;Cai&rsquo;s Feat Knoll or Terminus&rsquo;;
but compare p. 217 above. Before leaving Cai I may point out that
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb566" href="#v2pb566" name=
"v2pb566">566</a>]</span>tradition seems to ascribe to him as his
residence the place called <i>Caer Gai</i>, &lsquo;Cai&rsquo;s
Fort,&rsquo; between Bala and &#7930;anuwch&#7931;yn. If one may treat
Cai as a historical man, one may perhaps suppose him, or some member of
his family, commemorated by the vocable <i>Burgocavi</i> on an old
stone found at Caer Gai, and said to read: <i lang="la">Ic iacit
Salvianus Burgocavi filius Cupitiani</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e19490src" href="#xd26e19490" name=
"xd26e19490src">17</a>&mdash;&lsquo;Here lies Salvianus
Burgo<i>cavis</i>, son of Cupitianus.&rsquo; The reader may also be
referred back to such non-Brythonic and little known figures as
Daronwy, Cathbalug, and Brynach, together perhaps with Mengwaed, the
wolf-lord of Ar&#7931;echwe&#273;, pp. 504&ndash;5. It is worth while
calling attention likewise to Goidelic indications afforded by the
topography of Eryri, to wit such cases as <i>Bwlch Mwrchan</i> or
<i>Mwlchan</i>, &lsquo;Mwrchan&rsquo;s Pass,&rsquo; sometimes made into
<i>Bwlch Mwyalchen</i> or even <i>Bwlch y Fwyalchen</i>, &lsquo;the
Ousel&rsquo;s Gap,&rsquo; near &#7930;yn Gwynain; the remarkable
remains called <i>Muriau&rsquo;r Dre</i>, &lsquo;the Town
Walls&rsquo;&mdash;otherwise known as <i>Tre&rsquo;r
Gwy&#273;elod</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e19529src" href=
"#xd26e19529" name="xd26e19529src">18</a>, &lsquo;the Goidels&rsquo;
town&rsquo;&mdash;on the land of Gwastad Annas at the top of
Nanhwynain; and Bwlch y Gwy&#273;el, still higher towards Pen Gwryd,
may have meant the &lsquo;Goidel&rsquo;s Pass.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Probably a study of the topography on the spot would result in the
identification of more names similarly significant; but I will call
attention to only one of them, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb567"
href="#v2pb567" name="v2pb567">567</a>]</span>namely
<i>Be&#273;gelert</i> or, as it is locally pronounced,
<i>Bethgelart</i>, though the older spellings of the name appear to be
<i>Beth Kellarth</i> and <i>Beth Kelert</i>. Those who are acquainted
with the story, as told there, of the man who rashly killed his hound
might think that <i>Be&#273;gelert</i>, &lsquo;Gelert or Kelert&rsquo;s
Grave,&rsquo; refers to the hound; but there is a complete lack of
evidence to show this widely known story to have been associated with
the neighbourhood by antiquity<a class="noteref" id="xd26e19558src"
href="#xd26e19558" name="xd26e19558src">19</a>; and the compiler of the
notes and pedigrees known as <i>Bone&#273; y Saint</i> was probably
right in treating Kelert as the name of an ancient saint: see the
<i>Myvyr. Arch.</i>, ii. 36. In any case, <i>Kelert</i> or
<i>Gelert</i> with its <i>rt</i> cannot be a genuine Welsh name: the
older spellings seem to indicate two pronunciations&mdash;a Goidelic
one, <i>Kelert</i>, and a Welsh one, <i>Kelarth</i> or
<i>Ke&#7931;arth</i>, which has not survived. The documents, however,
in which the name occurs require to be carefully examined for the
readings which they supply.</p>
<p>Lastly, from the Goidels of Arfon must not be too violently severed
those of Mona, among whom we have found, pp. 504&ndash;5, the
mysterious Cathbalug, whose name, still half unexplained, reminds one
of such Irish ones as <i>Cathbuadach</i>, &lsquo;battle-victorious or
conquering in war&rsquo;; and to the same stratum belongs
<i>Daronwy</i>, p. 504, which survives as the name of a farm in the
parish of &#7930;anfachreth. The <i>Record of Carnarvon</i>, p. 59,
speaks both of a <i>Molendinum de Darronwy et Cornewe</i>, &lsquo;Mill
of Daronwy<a class="noteref" id="xd26e19606src" href="#xd26e19606"
name="xd26e19606src">20</a> and Cornwy,&rsquo; and of <i>Vill&aelig; de
Dorronwy et <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb568" href="#v2pb568"
name="v2pb568">568</a>]</span>Kuwghdornok</i>, &lsquo;Vills of Daronwy
and of the Cnwch Dernog,&rsquo; which has been mentioned as now
pronounced <i>Clwch Dernog</i>, p. 457: it is situated in the adjoining
parish of &#7930;an&#273;eusant. The name is given in the same
<i>Record</i> as <i>Dernok</i>, and is doubtless to be identified with
the Tern&oacute;c not very uncommon in Irish hagiology. With these
names the <i>Record</i> further associates a holding called <i>Wele
Conus</i>, and <i>Conus</i> survives in <i>Weun Gonnws</i>, the name of
a field on the farm of Bron Heulog, adjoining Clwch Dernog. That is not
all, for Connws turns out to be the Welsh pronunciation of the Goidelic
name <i>Cunagussus</i>, of which we have the Latinized genitive on the
Bodfe&#273;an menhir, some distance north-east of the railway station
of Ty Croes. It reads: <span class="sc" lang="la">CVNOGVSI HIC
IACIT</span>, &lsquo;Here lies (the body) of Cunagussus,&rsquo; and
involves a name which has regularly become in Irish <i>Conghus</i>,
while the native Welsh equivalent would be <i>Cynwst</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e19686src" href="#xd26e19686" name=
"xd26e19686src">21</a>. These names, and one<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e19752src" href="#xd26e19752" name="xd26e19752src">22</a> or two
more which might be added to them, suggest a very Goidelic population
as occupying, in the fifth or sixth century, the part of the island
west of a line from Amlwch to Ma&#7931;draeth.</p>
<p>Lastly, the chronological indications of the crushing <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb569" href="#v2pb569" name=
"v2pb569">569</a>]</span>of the power of the Goidels, and the incipient
merging of that people with the Brythons into a single nation of Kymry
or &lsquo;Compatriots,&rsquo; are worthy of a passing remark. We seem
to find the process echoed in the Triads when they mention as a
favourite at Arthur&rsquo;s Court the lord of Ar&#7931;echwe&#273;,
named Menwae&#273;, who has been guessed, p. 507 above, to have been a
Goidel. Then Serrigi and Daronwy are signalized as contemporaries of
Cadwa&#7931;on Law-hir, who inflicted on the former, according to the
later legend, the great defeat of Cerrig y Gwy&#273;yl<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e19781src" href="#xd26e19781" name=
"xd26e19781src">23</a>. The name, however, of the leader of the Goidels
arrayed against Cadwa&#7931;on may be regarded as unknown, and Serrigi
as a later name, probably of Norse origin, introduced from an account
of a tenth century struggle with invaders from the Scandinavian kingdom
of Dublin<a class="noteref" id="xd26e19793src" href="#xd26e19793" name=
"xd26e19793src">24</a>. In this conqueror we have <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb570" href="#v2pb570" name=
"v2pb570">570</a>]</span>probably all that can be historical of the
Caswa&#7931;on of the <i>Mabinogion</i> of Branwen and Manawy&#273;an,
that is, the Caswa&#7931;on who ousts the Goidelic family of &#7930;yr
from power in this country, and makes Pryderi of Dyfed pay homage to
him as supreme king of the island. His name has there undergone
assimilation to that of Cassivellaunos, and he is furthermore
represented as son of Beli, king of Prydain in the days of its
independence, before the advent of the legions of Rome. But as a
historical man we are to regard Caswa&#7931;on probably as
Cadwa&#7931;on Law-hir, grandson of Cune&#273;a and father of Maelgwn
of Gwyne&#273;. Now Cune&#273;a and his sons, according to Nennius
(&sect; 62), expelled the Goidels with terrible slaughter; and one may
say, with the Triads, which practically contradict Nennius&rsquo;
statement as to the Goidels being expelled, that Cune&#273;a&rsquo;s
grandson continued the struggle with them. In any case there were
Goidels still there, for the <i>Book of Taliessin</i> seems to give
evidence<a class="noteref" id="xd26e19881src" href="#xd26e19881" name=
"xd26e19881src">25</a> of a persistent hostility, on the part of the
Goidelic bards of Gwyne&#273;, to Maelgwn and the more Brythonic
institutions which he may be regarded as representing. This brings the
Goidelic element down to the sixth century<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e19887src" href="#xd26e19887" name="xd26e19887src">26</a>.
Maelgwn&rsquo;s death took place, according to the oldest manuscript of
the <i>Annales Cambri&aelig;</i>, in the year 547, or ten years after
the Battle of Camlan&mdash;in which, as it says, Arthur and Medrod
fell. Now some of this is history and some is not: where is the line to
be drawn? In any case, the attempt to answer that question could not be
justly met with contempt or treated as trivial.</p>
<p>The other cause, to which I suggested that contempt <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb571" href="#v2pb571" name=
"v2pb571">571</a>]</span>for folklore was probably to be traced,
together with the difficulties springing therefrom to beset the
folklorist&rsquo;s paths, is one&rsquo;s ignorance of the meaning of
many of the superstitions of our ancestors. I do not wish this to be
regarded as a charge of wilful ignorance; for one has frankly to
confess that many old superstitions and superstitious practices are
exceedingly hard to understand. So much so, that those who have most
carefully studied them cannot always agree with one another in their
interpretation. At first sight, some of the superstitions seem so silly
and absurd, that one cannot wonder that those who have not gone deeply
into the study of the human mind should think them trivial, foolish, or
absurd. It is, however, not improbable that they are the results of
early attempts to think out the mysteries of nature; and our difficulty
is that the thinking was so infantile, comparatively speaking, that one
finds it hard to put one&rsquo;s self back into the mental condition of
early man. But it should be clearly understood that our difficulty in
ascertaining the meaning of such superstitions is no proof whatsoever
that they had <i>no</i> meaning.</p>
<p>The chief initial difficulty, however, meeting any one who would
collect folklore in Wales arises from the fact that various influences
have conspired to laugh it out of court, so to say, so that those who
are acquainted with superstitions and ancient fads become ashamed to
own it: they have the fear of ridicule weighing on their minds, and
that is a weight not easily removed. I can recall several instances:
among others I may mention a lady who up to middle age believed
implicitly in the existence of fairies, and was most anxious that her
children should not wander away from home at any time when there
happened to be a mist, lest the fairies should carry them away to their
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb572" href="#v2pb572" name=
"v2pb572">572</a>]</span>home beneath a neighbouring lake. In her later
years, however, it was quite useless for a stranger to question her on
these things: fairy lore had been so laughed out of countenance in the
meantime, that at last she would not own, even to the members of her
own family, that she remembered anything about the fairies. Another
instance in point is supplied by the story of Caste&#7931;march, and by
my failure for a whole fortnight to elicit from the old blacksmith of
Aber Soch the legend of March ab Meirchion with horse&rsquo;s ears. Of
course I can readily understand the old man&rsquo;s shyness in
<span class="corr" id="xd26e19907" title=
"Source: repeatin">repeating</span> the story of March. Science,
however, knows no such shyness, as it is her business to pry into
everything and to discover, if possible, the why and wherefore of all
things. In this context let me for a moment revert to the story of
March, silly as it looks:&mdash;March was lord of Caste&#7931;march in
&#7930;eyn, and he had horse&rsquo;s ears; so lest the secret should be
known, every one who shaved him was killed forthwith; and in the spot
where the bodies were buried there grew reeds, which a bard cut in
order to provide himself with a pipe. The pipe when made would give no
music but words meaning <i>March has horse&rsquo;s ears</i>! There are
other forms of the story, but all substantially the same as that
preserved for us by &#7930;wyd (pp. 233&ndash;4), except that one of
them resembles more closely the Irish version about to be summarized.
It occurs in a manuscript in the Peniarth collection, and runs
thus:&mdash;March had horse&rsquo;s ears, a fact known to nobody but
his barber, who durst not make it known for fear of losing his head.
But the barber fell ill, so that he had to call in a physician, who
said that the patient was being killed by a secret; and he ordered him
to tell it to the ground. The barber having done so became well again,
and fine reeds grew <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb573" href=
"#v2pb573" name="v2pb573">573</a>]</span>on the spot. One day, as the
time of a great feast was drawing nigh, certain of the pipers of
Maelgwn Gwyne&#273; coming that way saw the reeds, some of which they
cut and used for their pipes. By-and-by they had to perform before King
March, when they could elicit from their pipes no strain but
&lsquo;Horse&rsquo;s ears for March ab Meirchion&rsquo; (<i lang=
"cy">klvstiav march i varch ab Meirchion</i>). Hence arose the
saying&mdash;&lsquo;That is gone on horns and pipes&rsquo; (<i lang=
"cy">vaeth hynny ar gyrn a ffibav</i>), which was as much as to say
that the secret is become more than public<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e19922src" href="#xd26e19922" name="xd26e19922src">27</a>.</p>
<p>The story, it is almost needless to say, can be traced also in
Cornwall and in Brittany<a class="noteref" id="xd26e19930src" href=
"#xd26e19930" name="xd26e19930src">28</a>; and not only among the
Brythonic peoples of those countries, but among the Goidels of Ireland
likewise. The Irish story runs thus<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e19936src" href="#xd26e19936" name=
"xd26e19936src">29</a>:&mdash;Once on a time there was a king over
Ireland whose name was Labraid Lorc, and this is the manner of man he
was&mdash;he had two horse&rsquo;s ears on him. And every one who
shaved the king used to be slain forthwith. Now the time of shaving him
drew nigh one day, when the son of a widow in the neighbourhood was
enjoined to do it. The widow went and besought the king that her son
should not be slain, and he promised her that he would be spared if he
would only keep his secret. So it came to pass; but the secret so
disagreed with the widow&rsquo;s son that he fell ill, and nobody could
divine the cause until a druid came by. He at once discovered that the
youth was ill of an uncommunicated secret, and ordered him to go to the
meeting of four roads. &lsquo;Let him,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;turn
sunwise, and the first tree he meets on the right side let him tell the
secret to it, and he will be well.&rsquo; This you <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb574" href="#v2pb574" name=
"v2pb574">574</a>]</span>might think was quite safe, as it was a tree
and not his mother, his sister, or his sweetheart; but you would be
quite mistaken in thinking so. The tree to which the secret was told
was a willow; and a famous Irish harper of that day, finding he wanted
a new harp, came and cut the makings of a harp from that very tree; but
when the harp was got ready and the harper proceeded to play on it, not
a note could he elicit but &lsquo;Labraid Lorc has horse&rsquo;s
ears!&rsquo; As to the barber&rsquo;s complaint, that was by no means
unnatural: it has often been noticed how a secret disagrees with some
natures, and how uneasy and restless it makes them until they can out
with it. The same thing also, in an aggravated form, occurs now and
then to a public man who has prepared a speech in the dark recesses of
his heart, but has to leave the meeting where he intended to have it
out, without finding his opportunity. Our neighbours on the other side
of the Channel have a technical term for that sort of sufferer: they
say of him that he is <i>malade d&rsquo;un discours rentr&eacute;</i>,
or ill of a speech which has gone into the patient&rsquo;s
constitution, like the measles or the small-pox when it fails to come
out. But to come back to the domain of folklore, I need only mention
the love-lorn knights in Malory&rsquo;s <i>Morte Darthur</i>, who
details their griefs in doleful strains to solitary fountains in the
forests: it seems to have relieved them greatly, and it sometimes
reached other ears than those of the wells. Now with regard to him of
the equine ears, some one might thoughtlessly suggest, that, if it ever
became a question of improving this kind of story, one should make the
ears into those of an ass. As a matter of fact there was a Greek story
of this kind, and in that story the man with the abnormal head was
called Midas, and his ears were said to be those of an ass. The reader
will find him figuring in most collections <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb575" href="#v2pb575" name=
"v2pb575">575</a>]</span>of Greek stories; so I need not pursue the
matter further, except to remark that the exact kind of brute ears was
possibly a question which different nations decided differently. At any
rate Stokes mentions a Serbian version in which the ears were those of
a goat.</p>
<p>What will, however, occur to everybody to ask, is&mdash;What was the
origin of such a story? what did it mean, if it had a meaning? Various
attempts have been made to interpret this kind of story, but nobody, so
far as I know, has found a sure key to its meaning. The best guess I
can make has been suggested in a previous chapter, from which it will
be seen that the horse fits the Welsh context, so to say, best, the
goat less well, and the ass probably least of all: see pp. 433&ndash;9
above. Supposing, then, the interpretation of the story established for
certain, the question of its origin would still remain. Did it
originate among the Celts and the Greeks and other nations who relate
it? or has it simply originated among one of those peoples and spread
itself to the others? or else have they all inherited it from a common
source? If we take the supposition that it originated independently
among a variety of people in the distant past, then comes an
interesting question as to the conditions under which it arose, and the
psychological state of the human race in the distant past. On the other
supposition one is forced to ask: Did the Celts get the story from the
Greeks, or the Greeks from the Celts, or neither from either, but from
a common source? Also when and how did the variations arise? In any
case, one cannot help seeing that a story like the one I have instanced
raises a variety of profoundly difficult and interesting questions.</p>
<p>Hard as the folklorist may find it to extract tales and legends from
the people of Wales at the present day, there is one thing which he
finds far more irritating <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb576" href=
"#v2pb576" name="v2pb576">576</a>]</span>than the taciturnity of the
peasant, and that is the hopeless fashion in which some of those who
have written about Welsh folklore have deigned to record the stories
which were known to them. Take as an instance the following, which
occurs in Howells&rsquo; <i>Cambrian Superstitions</i>, pp.
103&ndash;4:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In Cardiganshire there is a lake, beneath which it is
reported that a town lies buried; and in an arid summer, when the water
is low, a wall, on which people may walk, extending across the lake is
seen, and supposed to appertain to the inundated city or town; on one
side is a gigantic rock, which appears to have been split, as there is
a very extensive opening in it, which nearly divides it in twain, and
which tradition relates was thus occasioned:&mdash;Once upon a time
there was a person of the name of Pannog, who had two oxen, so large
that their like was never known in any part of the world, and of whom
it might be said,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">They ne&rsquo;er will look upon their like again.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">It chanced one day that one of them (and it appears
that they were not endued with a quantum of sense proportionate to
their bulk) was grazing near a precipice opposite the rock, and whether
it was his desire to commit suicide, or to cool his body by laving in
the lake below, one knows not, but certain it is that down he plunged,
and was never seen more: his partner searching for him a short time
after, and not perceiving any signs of his approach, bellowed almost as
loud as the Father of the Gods, who when he spake &ldquo;Earth to his
centre shook&rdquo;; however, the sound of his bleating [<i>sic</i>]
split the opposite rock, which from the circumstance is called
<i>Uchain Pannog</i> (Pannog&rsquo;s Oxen). These oxen were said to be
two persons, called in Wales, Nyniaf and Phebiaf, whom God turned into
beasts for their sins.<a id="xd26e19976" name="xd26e19976"></a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb577" href="#v2pb577" name=
"v2pb577">577</a>]</span></p>
<p>Here it is clear that Mr. Howells found a portion, if not the whole,
of his story in Welsh, taken partly from the Kulhwch story, and
apparently in the old spelling; for his own acquaintance with the
language did not enable him to translate <i lang="cy">Nynnya&#7933; a
pheiba&#7933;</i> into &lsquo;Nynio and Peibio.&rsquo; The slenderness
of his knowledge of Welsh is otherwise proved throughout his book,
especially by the way in which he spells Welsh words: in fact one need
not go beyond this very story with its <i lang="cy">Uchain Pannog</i>.
But when he had ascertained that the lake was in Cardiganshire he might
have gone a little further and have told his readers which lake it was.
It is not one of the lakes which I happen to know in the north of the
county&mdash;&#7930;yn &#7930;ygad y Rheidol on Plinlimmon, or the lake
on Moel y &#7930;yn to the north of Cwm Ceulan, or either of the Iwan
Lakes which drain into the Merin (or Meri), a tributary of the Mynach,
which flows under <i>Pont ar Fynach</i>, called in English the
Devil&rsquo;s Bridge. From inquiry I cannot find either that it is any
one of the pools in the east of the county, such as those of the Teifi,
or &#7930;yn Ferwyn, not far from the gorge known as Cwm Berwyn,
mentioned in Edward Richards&rsquo; well known lines, p. 43:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">

</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">It rains in Cwm Berwyn, the shadows are growing,</p>
<p class="line">To-night make my cabin the end of thy journey.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">There is, it is true, a pool at a place called Maes y
&#7930;yn in the neighbourhood of Tregaron, as to which there is a
tradition that a village once occupied the place of its waters:
otherwise it shows no similarity to the lake of Howells&rsquo; story.
Then there is a group of lakes in which the river Aeron takes its rise:
they are called &#7930;yn Ei&#273;wen, &#7930;yn Fanod, and &#7930;yn
Farch. As to &#7930;yn Ei&#273;wen, I had it years ago that at one time
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb578" href="#v2pb578" name=
"v2pb578">578</a>]</span>there was a story current concerning
&lsquo;wild cattle,&rsquo; which used to come out of its waters and
rush back into them when disturbed. In the middle of this piece of
water, which has a rock on one side of it, is a small island with a
modern building on it; and one would like to know whether it shows any
traces of early occupation. Then as to &#7930;yn Farch, there is a
story going that there came out of it once on a time a wonderful
animal, which was shot by a neighbouring farmer. Lastly, at &#7930;yn
Fanod there are boundary walls which go right out into the lake; and my
informant thinks the same is the case with &#7930;yn
Ei&#273;wen<a class="noteref" id="xd26e20009src" href="#xd26e20009"
name="xd26e20009src">30</a>. One of these walls is probably what in
Howells&rsquo; youthful hands developed itself into a causeway. The
other part of his story, referring to the lowing of the <i>Bannog
Oxen</i>, comes from a well known doggerel which runs thus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>&#7930;an &#272;ewi Frefi fraith<a class="noteref"

<p class="line"><i>&#7930;e brefo&#273; yr ych naw gwaith,</i></p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="line">&#7930;an&#273;ewi of Brefi the spotted,</p>
<p class="line">Where bellowed the ox nine times,</p>
<p class="line">Till the Foela&#7931;t rock split in two.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">Brefi is the name of the river from which this
&#7930;an&#273;ewi takes its distinctive name; and it is pronounced
there much the same as <i>brefu</i>, &lsquo;the act of lowing,
bellowing, or bleating.&rsquo; Now the Brefi runs down through the
Foela&#7931;t Farm, which lies between two very big rocks popularly
fancied to have been once united, and treated by Howells, somewhat
inconsistently, as the permanent forms taken by the two oxen. The story
which Howells seems to have jumbled up with that of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb579" href="#v2pb579" name=
"v2pb579">579</a>]</span>one or more lake legends, is to be found given
in Samuel Rush Meyrick&rsquo;s <i>County of Cardigan</i>: see pp.
265&ndash;6, where one reads of a wild tradition that when the church
was building there were two oxen to draw the stone required; and one of
the two died in the effort to drag the load, while the other bellowed
nine times and thereby split the hill, which before presented itself as
an obstacle. The single ox was then able to bring the load unassisted
to the site of the church. It is to this story that the doggerel
already given refers; and, curiously enough, most of the district
between &#7930;an&#273;ewi and <i>Ystrad Fflur</i>, or Strata Florida,
is more or less associated with the <i>Ychen Bannog</i>. Thus a ridge
running east and west at a distance of some three miles from Tregaron,
and separating Upper and Lower Caron from one another, bears the name
of <i>Cwys yr Ychen Bannog</i>, or the Furrow of the <i>Ychen
Bannog</i>. It somewhat resembles in appearance an ancient dyke, but it
is said to be nothing but &lsquo;a long bank of glacial till<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e20065src" href="#xd26e20065" name=
"xd26e20065src">32</a>.&rsquo; Moreover there used to be preserved
within the church of &#7930;an&#273;ewi a remarkable fragment of a horn
commonly called <i>Madcorn yr Ych Bannog</i>, &lsquo;the <i>mabcorn</i>
or core of the Bannog Ox&rsquo;s Horn.&rsquo; It is now in the
possession of Mr. Parry of &#7930;idiardau, near Aberystwyth; and it
has been pronounced by Prof. Boyd Dawkins to have belonged to
&lsquo;the great urus (<i>Bos Primigenius</i>), that Charlemagne hunted
in the forests of Aachen, and the monks of St. Galle ate on their feast
days.&rsquo; He adds that the condition of the horn proves it to have
been derived from a peat bog or alluvium<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e20081src" href="#xd26e20081" name="xd26e20081src">33</a>. On the
whole, it seems to me probable that the wild legends about the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb580" href="#v2pb580" name=
"v2pb580">580</a>]</span><i>Ychen Bannog</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e20087src" href="#xd26e20087" name="xd26e20087src">34</a> in
Cardiganshire have underlying them a substratum of tradition going back
to a time when the urus was not as yet extinct in Wales. How far the
urus was once treated in this country as an emblem of divinity, it is
impossible to say; but from ancient Gaul we have such a name as
<i>Urogeno-nertus</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e20215src" href=
"#xd26e20215" name="xd26e20215src">35</a>, meaning a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb581" href="#v2pb581" name=
"v2pb581">581</a>]</span>man of the strength of an <i>Urogen</i>, that
is, of the offspring of a urus; not to mention the Gaulish <i>Tarvos
Trigaranus</i>, or the bull with three cranes on his back. With this
divine animal M. d&rsquo;Arbois de Jubainville would identify the
<i>Donnos</i> underlying such Gallo-Roman names as <i>Donnotaurus</i>,
and that of the wonderful bull called <i>Donn</i> in the principal epic
story of Ireland<a class="noteref" id="xd26e20239src" href=
"#xd26e20239" name="xd26e20239src">36</a>, where we seem to trace the
same element in the river-name given by Ptolemy as <i>Mo-donnos</i>,
one of the streams of Wicklow, or else the Slaney. This would be the
earliest instance known of the prefixing of the pronoun <i>mo</i>,
&lsquo;my,&rsquo; in its reverential application, which was confined in
later ages to the names of Goidelic saints.</p>
<p>To return, however, to the folklorist&rsquo;s difficulties, the
first thing to be done is to get as ample a supply of folklore
materials as possible; and here I come to a point at which some of the
readers of these pages could probably help; for we want all our
folklore and superstitions duly recorded and rescued from the yawning
gulf of oblivion, into which they are rapidly and irretrievably
dropping year by year, as the oldest inhabitant passes away.</p>
<p>Some years ago I attempted to collect the stories still remembered
in Wales about fairies and lake dwellers; and I seem to have thrown
some amount of enthusiasm into that pursuit. At any rate, one editor of
a Welsh newspaper congratulated me on being a thorough believer in the
fairies. Unfortunately, I was not nearly so successful in recommending
myself as a believer to the old people who could have related to me the
kind of stories I wanted. Nevertheless, the best <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb582" href="#v2pb582" name=
"v2pb582">582</a>]</span>plan I found was to begin by relating a story
about the fairies myself: if that method did not result in eliciting
anything from the listener, then it was time to move on to try the
experiment on another subject. Among the things which I then found was
the fact, that most of the well known lakes and tarns of Wales were
once believed to have had inhabitants of a fairy kind, who owned cattle
that sometimes came ashore and mixed with the ordinary breeds, while an
occasional lake lady became the wife of a shepherd or farmer in the
neighbourhood. There must, however, be many more of these legends
lurking in out of the way parts of Wales in connexion with the more
remote mountain tarns; and it would be well if they were collected
systematically.</p>
<p>One of the most complete and best known of these lake stories is
that of &#7930;yn y Fan Fach in the Beacons of Carmarthenshire, called
in Welsh <i>Bannau Sir Gaer</i>. The story is so much more
circumstantial than all the others, that it has been placed at the
beginning of this volume. Next to it may be ranked that of the Ystrad
Dyfodwg pool, now known as &#7930;yn y Forwyn, the details of which
have only recently been unearthed for me by a friend: see pp.
27&ndash;30 above. Well, in the Fan Fach legend the lake lady marries a
young farmer from My&#273;fai, on the Carmarthenshire side of the
range; and she is to remain his wife so long as he lives without
striking her three times without cause. When that happens, she leaves
him and calls away with her all her live stock, down to the little
black calf in the process of being flayed; for he suddenly dons his
hide and hurries away after the rest of the stock into the lake. The
three blows without cause seem to belong to a category of very ancient
determinants which have been recently discussed, with his usual acumen
and command of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb583" href="#v2pb583"
name="v2pb583">583</a>]</span>instances from other lands, by Mr.
Hartland, in the chapters on the Swan Maidens in his <i>Science of
Fairy Tales</i>. But our South Welsh story allows the three blows only
a minimum of force; and in North Wales the determinant is of a
different kind, though probably equally ancient: for there the husband
must not strike or touch the fairy wife with anything made of iron, a
condition which probably points back to the Stone Age. For
arch&aelig;ologists are agreed, that before metal, whether iron or
bronze, was used in the manufacturing of tools, stone was the universal
material for all cutting tools and weapons. But as savages are
profoundly conservative in their habits, it is argued that on
ceremonial and religious occasions knives of stone continued to be the
only ones admissible long after bronze ones had been in common use for
ordinary purposes. Take for example the text of Exodus iv. 25, where
Zipporah is mentioned circumcising her son with a flint. From instances
of the kind one may comprehend the sort of way in which iron came to be
regarded as an abomination and a horror to the fairies. The question
will be found discussed by Mr. Hartland at length in his book mentioned
above: see more especially pp. 305&ndash;9.</p>
<p>Such, to my mind, are some of the questions to which the fairies
give rise: I now wish to add another turning on the reluctance of the
fairies to disclose their names. There is one story in particular which
would serve to illustrate this admirably; but it is one which, I am
sorry to say, I have never been able to discover complete or coherent
in Wales. The substance of it should be, roughly speaking, as
follows:&mdash;A woman finds herself in great distress and is delivered
out of it by a fairy, who claims as reward the woman&rsquo;s baby. On a
certain day the baby will inevitably be taken by the fairy unless the
fairy&rsquo;s true name is discovered by the mother. The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb584" href="#v2pb584" name=
"v2pb584">584</a>]</span>fairy is foiled by being in the meantime
accidentally overheard exulting, that the mother does not know that his
or her name is Rumpelstiltzchen, or whatever it may be in the version
which happens to be in question. The best known version is the German
one, where the fairy is called Rumpelstiltzchen; and it will be found
in the ordinary editions of Grimm&rsquo;s <i>M&auml;rchen</i>. The most
complete English version is the East Anglian one published by Mr.
Edward Clodd, in his recent volume entitled <i>Tom Tit Tot</i>, pp.
8&ndash;16; and previously in an article full of research headed
&lsquo;The Philosophy of Rumpelstiltskin,&rsquo; in <i>Folk-Lore</i>
for 1889, pp. 138&ndash;43. It is first to be noted that in this
version the fairy&rsquo;s name is Tom Tit Tot, and that the German and
the East Anglian stories run parallel. They agree in making the fairy a
male, in which they differ from our Welsh Silly Frit and Silly go Dwt:
in what other respect the story of our Silly differed from that of
Rumpelstiltzchen and Tom Tit Tot it is, in the present incomplete state
of the Welsh one, impossible to say. Here it may be found useful to
recall the fragments of the Welsh story: (1) A fairy woman used to come
out of Corwrion Pool to spin on fine summer days, and whilst spinning
she sang or hummed to herself <i>s&igrave;li ffrit, s&igrave;li
ffrit</i>&mdash;it does not rise even to a doggerel couplet: see p. 64
above. (2) A farmer&rsquo;s wife in &#7930;eyn used to have visits from
a fairy woman who came to borrow things from her; and one day when the
goodwife had lent her a <i>troe&#7931; bach</i>, or wheel for spinning
flax, she asked the fairy to give her name, which she declined to do.
She was, however, overheard to sing to the whir of the wheel as follows
(p. 229):&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>Bychan a wy&#273;a&rsquo; hi</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>Mai S&igrave;li go Dwt</i></p>

</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Little did she know</p>
<p class="line">That Silly go Dwt</p>
<p class="line">Is my name.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">This throws some light on Silly Frit, and we know
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb585" href="#v2pb585" name=
"v2pb585">585</a>]</span>where we are; but the story is inconsequent,
and far from representing the original. We cannot, however, reconstruct
it quite on the lines of Grimm&rsquo;s or Clodd&rsquo;s version. But I
happened to mention my difficulty one day to Dr. J. A. H. Murray, when
he assured me of the existence of a Scottish version in which the fairy
is a female. He learnt it when he was a child, he said, at Denholm, in
Roxburghshire; and he was afterwards charmed to read it in Robert
Chambers&rsquo; <i>Popular Rhymes of Scotland</i> (Edinburgh, 1858),
pp. 221&ndash;5, whence Mr. Clodd has given an abstract of it in his
&lsquo;Philosophy of Rumpelstiltskin.&rsquo; Among those popular rhymes
the reader will find it as related at length by Nurse Jenny in her
inimitable fashion; but the Scotch is so broad, that I think it
advisable, at the risk of some havoc to the local colouring, to
southronize it somewhat as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I see that you are fond of talks about fairies, children; and
a story about a fairy and the goodwife of Kittlerumpit has just come
into my mind; but I can&rsquo;t very well tell you now whereabouts
Kittlerumpit lies. I think it is somewhere in the Debatable Ground;
anyway I shall not pretend to know more than I do, like everybody
nowadays. I wish they would remember the ballad we used to sing long
ago:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Mony ane sings the gerss, the gerss,</p>
<p class="line">And mony ane sings the corn;</p>
<p class="line">And mony ane clatters o&rsquo; bold Robin Hood,</p>
<p class="line">Ne&rsquo;er kent where he was born.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">But howsoever about Kittlerumpit: the goodman was a
rambling sort of body; and he went to a fair one day, and not only
never came home again, but nevermore was heard of. Some said he
&lsquo;listed, and others that the tiresome pressgang snatched him up,
though he was furnished with a wife and a child to boot. Alas! that
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb586" href="#v2pb586" name=
"v2pb586">586</a>]</span>wretched pressgang! They went about the
country like roaring lions, seeking whom they might devour. Well do I
remember how my eldest brother Sandy was all but smothered in the
meal-chest, hiding from those rascals. After they were gone, we pulled
him out from among the meal, puffing and crying, and as white as any
corpse. My mother had to pick the meal out of his mouth with the shank
of a horn spoon.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah well, when the goodman of Kittlerumpit was gone, the
goodwife was left with small means. Little resources had she, and a
baby boy at her breast. All said they were sorry for her; but nobody
helped her&mdash;which is a common case, sirs. Howsoever the goodwife
had a sow, and that was her only consolation; for the sow was soon to
farrow, and she hoped for a good litter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But we all know hope is fallacious. One day the woman goes to
the sty to fill the sow&rsquo;s trough; and what does she find but the
sow lying on her back, grunting and groaning, and ready to give up the
ghost.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I trow this was a new pang to the goodwife&rsquo;s heart; so
she sat down on the knocking-stone<a class="noteref" id="xd26e20344src"
href="#xd26e20344" name="xd26e20344src">37</a>, with her bairn on her
knee, and cried sorer than ever she did for the loss of her own
goodman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now I premise that the cottage of Kittlerumpit was built on a
brae, with a large fir-wood behind it, of which you may hear more ere
we go far on. So the goodwife, when she was wiping her eyes, chances to
look down the brae; and what does she see but an old woman, almost like
a lady, coming slowly up the road. She was dressed in green, all but a
short white apron and a black velvet hood, and a steeple-crowned beaver
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb587" href="#v2pb587" name=
"v2pb587">587</a>]</span>hat on her head. She had a long walking-staff,
as long as herself, in her hand&mdash;the sort of staff that old men
and old women helped themselves with long ago; I see no such staffs
now, sirs.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah well, when the goodwife saw the green gentlewoman near
her, she rose and made a curtsy; and &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; quoth she,
weeping, &ldquo;I am one of the most misfortunate women
alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish to hear pipers&rsquo; news
and fiddlers&rsquo; tales, goodwife,&rdquo; quoth the green woman.
&ldquo;I know you have lost your goodman&mdash;we had worse losses at
the Sheriff Muir<a class="noteref" id="xd26e20355src" href=
"#xd26e20355" name="xd26e20355src">38</a>; and I know that your sow is
unco sick. Now what will you give me if I cure her?&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="corr" id="xd26e20359" title=
"Source: &ldquo;&lsquo;">&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;</span>Anything your
ladyship&rsquo;s madam likes,&rdquo; quoth the witless goodwife, never
guessing whom she had to deal with.</p>
<p><span class="corr" id="xd26e20364" title=
"Source: &ldquo;&lsquo;">&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;</span>Let us wet thumbs
on that bargain,&rdquo; quoth the green woman; so thumbs were wetted, I
warrant you; and into the sty madam marches.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She looks at the sow with a long stare, and then began to
mutter to herself what the goodwife couldn&rsquo;t well understand; but
she said it sounded like&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Pitter patter,</p>
<p class="line">Holy Water.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">&lsquo;Then she took out of her pocket a wee bottle,
with something like oil in it; and she rubs the sow with it above the
snout, behind the ears, and on the tip of the tail. &ldquo;Get up,
beast,&rdquo; quoth the green woman. No sooner said than done&mdash;up
jumps the sow with a grunt, and away to her trough for her
breakfast.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The goodwife of Kittlerumpit was a joyful goodwife now, and
would have kissed the very hem of the green woman&rsquo;s gowntail; but
she wouldn&rsquo;t let her. &ldquo;I am not <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb588" href="#v2pb588" name=
"v2pb588">588</a>]</span>so fond of ceremonies,&rdquo; quoth she;
&ldquo;but now that I have righted your sick beast, let us end our
settled bargain. You will not find me an unreasonable, greedy
body&mdash;I like ever to do a good turn for a small reward: all I ask,
and <i>will</i> have, is that baby boy in your bosom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The goodwife of Kittlerumpit, who now knew her customer, gave
a shrill cry like a stuck swine. The green woman was a fairy, no doubt;
so she prays, and cries, and begs, and scolds; but all wouldn&rsquo;t
do. &ldquo;You may spare your din,&rdquo; quoth the fairy,
&ldquo;screaming as if I was as deaf as a door-nail; but this
I&rsquo;ll let you know&mdash;I cannot, by <i>the law</i> we live
under, take your bairn till the third day; and not then, if you can
tell me my right name.&rdquo; So madam goes away round the pig-sty end;
and the goodwife falls down in a swoon behind the knocking-stone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah well, the goodwife of Kittlerumpit could not sleep any
that night for crying, and all the next day the same, cuddling her
bairn till she nearly squeezed its breath out; but the second day she
thinks of taking a walk in the wood I told you of; and so with the
bairn in her arms, she sets out, and goes far in among the trees, where
was an old quarry-hole, grown over with grass, and a bonny spring well
in the middle of it. Before she came very near, she hears the whirring
of a flax wheel, and a voice singing a song; so the woman creeps
quietly among the bushes, and peeps over the brow of the quarry; and
what does she see but the green fairy tearing away at her wheel, and
singing like any precentor:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Little kens our guid dame at hame,</p>
<p class="line">That Whuppity Stoorie is my name.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;Ha, ha!&rdquo; thinks the woman,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got the mason&rsquo;s word at last; the devil give
them joy that told it!&rdquo; So she went home far lighter than she
came out, as you may <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb589" href=
"#v2pb589" name="v2pb589">589</a>]</span>well guess&mdash;laughing like
a madcap with the thought of cheating the old green fairy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah well, you must know that this goodwife was a jocose woman,
and ever merry when her heart was not very sorely overladen. So she
thinks to have some sport with the fairy; and at the appointed time she
puts the bairn behind the knocking-stone, and sits on the stone
herself. Then she pulls her cap over her left ear and twists her mouth
on the other side, as if she were weeping; and an ugly face she made,
you may be sure. She hadn&rsquo;t long to wait, for up the brae climbs
the green fairy, neither lame nor lazy; and long ere she got near the
knocking-stone she screams out&mdash;&ldquo;Goodwife of Kittlerumpit,
you know well what I come for&mdash;stand and deliver!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The woman pretends to cry harder than before, and wrings her
hands, and falls on her knees, with &ldquo;Och, sweet madam mistress,
spare my only bairn, and take the wretched sow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;The devil take the sow, for my part,&rdquo;
quoth the fairy; &ldquo;I come not here for swine&rsquo;s flesh.
Don&rsquo;t be contramawcious, huzzy, but give me the child
instantly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;Ochone, dear lady mine,&rdquo; quoth the crying
goodwife; &ldquo;forgo my poor bairn, and take me myself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;The devil is in the daft jade,&rdquo; quoth the
fairy, looking like the far end of a fiddle; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet she
is clean demented. Who in all the earthly world, with half an eye in
his head, would ever meddle with the likes of thee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I trow this set up the woman of Kittlerumpit&rsquo;s bristle:
for though she had two blear eyes and a long red nose besides, she
thought herself as bonny as the best of them. So she springs off her
knees, sets the top of her cap straight, and with her two hands folded
before her, she makes a curtsy down to the ground, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb590" href="#v2pb590" name=
"v2pb590">590</a>]</span>and, &ldquo;In troth, fair madam,&rdquo; quoth
she, &ldquo;I might have had the wit to know that the likes of me is
not fit to tie the worst shoe-strings of the high and mighty princess,
<i>Whuppity Stoorie</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If a flash of gunpowder had come out of the ground it
couldn&rsquo;t have made the fairy leap higher than she did; then down
she came again plump on her shoe-heels; and whirling round, she ran
down the brae, screeching for rage, like an owl chased by the
witches.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The goodwife of Kittlerumpit laughed till she was like to
split; then she takes up her bairn, and goes into her house, singing to
it all the way:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">A goo and a gitty, my bonny wee tyke,</p>
<p class="line">Ye&rsquo;se noo ha&rsquo;e your four-oories;</p>
<p class="line">Sin&rsquo; we&rsquo;ve gien Nick a bane to pyke,</p>
<p class="line">Wi&rsquo; his wheels and his Whuppity
Stoories.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">That is practically Chambers&rsquo; version of this
Scottish story; and as to the name of the fairy <i>Whuppity
Stoorie</i>, the first syllable should be the equivalent of English
<i>whip</i>, while <i>stoor</i> is a Scotch word for dust in motion: so
the editor asks in a note whether the name may not have originated in
the notion &lsquo;that fairies were always present in the whirls of
dust occasioned by the wind on roads and in streets<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e20441src" href="#xd26e20441" name=
"xd26e20441src">39</a>.&rsquo; But he adds that another version of the
story calls the green woman <i>Fittletetot</i>, which ends with the
same element as the name Tom Tit Tot and Silly go Dwt. Perhaps,
however, the Welsh versions of the story approached nearest to one from
Mochdrum in Wigtownshire, published in the British Association&rsquo;s
<i>Papers of the Liverpool Meeting</i>, 1896, p. 613. This story was
contributed by the Rev. Walter Gregor, and the name of the fairy in it
is Marget Totts: in this we have a wife, who is in great distress,
because her husband used to give her so much flax to spin by such and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb591" href="#v2pb591" name=
"v2pb591">591</a>]</span>such a day, that the work was beyond human
power. A fairy comes to the rescue and takes the flax away, promising
to bring it back spun by the day fixed, provided the woman can tell the
fairy&rsquo;s name. The woman&rsquo;s distress thereupon becomes as
great as before, but the fairy was overheard saying as she span,
&lsquo;Little does the guidwife ken it, my name is Marget Totts.&rsquo;
So the woman got her flax returned spun by the day; and the fairy,
Marget Totts, went up the chimney in a blaze of fire as the result of
rage and disappointment. Here one cannot help seeing that the original,
of which this is a clumsy version, must have been somewhat as
follows</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Little does the guidwife wot</p>
<p class="line">That my name is Marget Tot.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">To come back to Wales, we have there the names Silly
Frit and Silly go Dwt, which are those of females. The former name is
purely English&mdash;<i>Silly Frit</i>, which has been already guessed
(p. 66) to mean a silly sprite, or silly apparition, with the idea of
its being a fright of a creature to behold: compare the application
elsewhere to a fairy changeling of the terms <i>crimbil</i> (p. 263)
and <i>cyrfaglach</i> or <i>cryfaglach</i> (p. 450), which is explained
as implying a haggard urchin that has been half starved and stunted in
its growth. Leaving out of the reckoning this connotation, one might
compare the term with the Scottish habit of calling the fairies silly
wights, &lsquo;the Happy Wights.&rsquo; See J. Jamieson&rsquo;s
<i>Scottish Dictionary</i>, where s. v. <i>seily, seely</i>,
&lsquo;happy,&rsquo; he purports to quote the following lines from
&lsquo;the Legend of the Bishop of St. Androis&rsquo; in a collection
of <i>Scottish Poems of the Sixteenth Century</i> (Edinburgh, 1801),
pp. 320&ndash;1:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">

<p class="first">Similarly, he gives the fairies the name of <i>Seely
Court</i>, and cites as illustrating it the following lines from R.

189:&mdash;</p>

</div>
<p class="first">Into Welsh, however, the designation Silly Frit must
have come, not from Scotland, but from the Marches; and the history of
<i>S&igrave;li go Dwt</i> must be much the same. For, though construed
as Welsh, the name would mean the Silly who is <i>go Dwt</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e20536src" href="#xd26e20536" name=
"xd26e20536src">40</a>, &lsquo;somewhat tidy or natty&rsquo;; but the
<i>dwt</i> (mutated from <i>twt</i>) was suggested doubtless by the
<i>tot</i> of such fairy names as Tom Tit Tot. That brings me to
another group, where the syllable is <i>trot</i> or <i>trut</i>, and
this we have in the Welsh doggerel, mentioned at p. 229, as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>Bychan a wy&#273;a&rsquo; hi</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>Mai Trwtyn-Tratyn</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>Yw f&rsquo;enw i.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Little did she know</p>
<p class="line">That Trwtyn Tratyn</p>
<p class="line">Is my name.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">But this name Trwtyn-Tratyn sounds masculine, and not
that of a she-fairy such as Silly Frit. The feminine would have been
Trwtan-Tratan in the Carnarvonshire pronunciation, and in fact
<i>trwtan</i> is to be heard there; but more frequently a kind of
derivative <i>trwdlan</i>, meaning <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb593" href="#v2pb593" name="v2pb593">593</a>]</span>an ungainly
sort of woman, a drudge, a short-legged or deformed maid of all work.
Some Teutonic varieties of this group of stories will be found
mentioned briefly in Mr. Clodd&rsquo;s article on the &lsquo;Philosophy
of Rumpelstiltskin<a class="noteref" id="xd26e20611src" href=
"#xd26e20611" name="xd26e20611src">41</a>.&rsquo; Thus from the
Debatable Ground on the borders of England and Scotland there comes a
story in which the fairy woman&rsquo;s name was Habetrot; and he
alludes to an Icelandic version in which the name is Gillitrut; but for
us still more interest attaches to the name in the following
rhyme<a class="noteref" id="xd26e20617src" href="#xd26e20617" name=
"xd26e20617src">42</a>:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Little does my lady wot</p>
<p class="line">That my name is Trit-a-Trot.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">This has been supposed to belong to a story coming
from Ireland; but whether that may prove true or not, it is hardly to
be doubted that our Trwtyn Tratyn is practically to be identified with
Trit-a-Trot, who is also a he-fairy.</p>
<p>That is not all; for since the foregoing notes were penned, a tale
has reached me from Mr. Craigfryn Hughes about a fairy who began by
conducting himself like the brownies mentioned at pp. 287, 324&ndash;5
above. The passages here in point come from the story of which a part
was given at pp. 462&ndash;4; and they are to the following
effect:&mdash;Long ago there was in service at a Monmouthshire farm a
young woman who was merry and strong. Who she was or whence she came
nobody knew; but many believed that she belonged to the old breed of
<i>Bendith y Mamau</i>. Some time after she had come to the farm, the
rumour spread that the house was sorely troubled by a spirit. But the
girl and the elf understood one another well, and they <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb594" href="#v2pb594" name=
"v2pb594">594</a>]</span>became the best of friends. So the elf proved
very useful to the maid, for he did everything for her&mdash;washing,
ironing, spinning and twisting wool; in fact they say that he was
remarkably handy at the spinning-wheel. Moreover, he expected only a
bowlful of sweet milk and wheat bread, or some flummery, for his work.
So she took care to place the bowl with his food at the bottom of the
stairs every night as she went to bed. It ought to have been mentioned
that she was never allowed to catch a sight of him; for he always did
his work in the dark. Nor did anybody know when he ate his food: she
used to leave the bowl there at night, and it would be empty by the
time when she got up in the morning, the <i>bwca</i> having cleared it.
But one night, by way of cursedness, what did she do but fill the bowl
with some of the stale urine which they used in dyeing wool and other
things about the house. But heavens! it would have been better for her
not to have done it; for when she got up next morning what should he do
but suddenly spring from some corner and seize her by the neck! He
began to beat her and kick her from one end of the house to the other,
while he shouted at the top of his voice at every kick:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">

</div>
<p class="first">Meanwhile she screamed for help, but none came for
some time; when, however, he heard the servant men getting up, he took
to his heels as hard as he could; and nothing was heard of him for some
time. But at the end of two years he was found to be at another farm in
the neighbourhood, called Hafod yr Ynys, where he at once became great
friends with the servant girl: for she fed him like a young chicken, by
giving him a little bread and milk all the time. So he worked willingly
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb595" href="#v2pb595" name=
"v2pb595">595</a>]</span>and well for her in return for his favourite
food. More especially, he used to spin and wind the yarn for her; but
she wished him in time to show his face, or to tell her his name: he
would by no means do either. One evening, however, when all the men
were out, and when he was spinning hard at the wheel, she deceived him
by telling him that she was also going out. He believed her; and when
he heard the door shutting, he began to sing as he plied the
wheel:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>Hi war&#273;a&rsquo;n iawn pe gwypa hi,</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>Taw Gwarwyn-a-throt yw&rsquo;m enw i.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">How she would laugh, did she know</p>
<p class="line">That Gwarwyn-a-throt is my name!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">&lsquo;Ha! ha!&rsquo; said the maid at the bottom of
the stairs; &lsquo;I know thy name now.&rsquo; &lsquo;What is it,
then?&rsquo; he asked. She replied, &lsquo;Gwarwyn-a-throt&rsquo;; and
as soon as she uttered the words he left the wheel where it was, and
off he went. He was next heard of at a farmhouse not far off, where
there happened to be a servant man named Moses, with whom he became
great friends at once. He did all his work for Moses with great ease.
He once, however, gave him a good beating for doubting his word; but
the two remained together afterwards for some years on the best
possible terms: the end of it was that Moses became a soldier. He went
away to fight against Richard Crookback, and fell on the field of
Bosworth. The bogie, after losing his friend, began to be troublesome
and difficult to live with. He would harass the oxen when they
ploughed, and draw them after him everywhere, plough and all; nor could
any one prevent them. Then, when the sun set in the evening he would
play his pranks again, and do all sorts of mischief about the house,
upstairs, and in the cowhouses. So the farmer was advised to visit a
wise man (<i>dyn cynnil</i>), and to see if he could devise some means
of getting rid of the bogie. He called on the wise man, who happened to
be living near Caerleon <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb596" href=
"#v2pb596" name="v2pb596">596</a>]</span>on the Usk; and the wise man,
having waited till the moon should be full, came to the farmer&rsquo;s
house. In due time the wise man, by force of man&oelig;uvring, secured
the bogie by the very long nose which formed the principal ornament of
his face, and earned for him the name of <i>Bwca&rsquo;r Trwyn</i>,
&lsquo;the Bogie of the Nose.&rsquo; Whilst secured by the nose, the
bogie had something read to him out of the wise man&rsquo;s big book;
and he was condemned by the wise man to be transported to the banks of
the Red Sea for fourteen generations, and to be conveyed thither by
&lsquo;the upper wind&rsquo; (<i>yr uwchwynt</i>). No sooner had this
been pronounced by the cunning man than there came a whirlwind which
made the whole house shake. Then came a still mightier wind, and as it
began to blow the owner of the big book drew the awl out of the
bogie&rsquo;s nose; and it is supposed that the bogie was carried away
by that wind, for he never troubled the place any more.</p>
<p>Another version of the story seems to have been current, which
represented the bogie as in no wise to blame<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e20693src" href="#xd26e20693" name="xd26e20693src">43</a>: but I
attach some importance to the foregoing tale as forming a link of
connexion between the Rumpelstiltzchen group of fairies, always trying
to get hold of children; the brownie kind, ever willing to serve in
return for their simple keep; and the troublesome bogie, that used to
haunt Welsh farm houses and delight in breaking crockery and
frightening the inmates out of their wits. In fact, the brownie and the
bogie reduce themselves here into different humours of the same uncanny
being. Their appearance may be said to have differed also: the bogie
had a very long nose, while the brownie of Blednoch had only &lsquo;a
hole where a nose should <span class="corr" id="xd26e20699" title=
"Source: hae">have</span> been.&rsquo; But one of the most remarkable
points about the brownie species is that the Lincolnshire <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb597" href="#v2pb597" name=
"v2pb597">597</a>]</span>specimen was a small creature, &lsquo;a weeny
bit of a fellow&rsquo;&mdash;which suggests a possible community of
origin with the banshee of the Irish, and also of the Welsh: witness
the wee little woman in the story of the Curse of Pantannas (pp.
188&ndash;9), who seems to come up out of the river. All alike may
perhaps be said to suggest various aspects of the dead ancestor or
ancestress; but Bwca&rsquo;r Trwyn is not to be severed from the fairy
woman in the Pennant Valley, who undertakes some of the duties, not of
a dairymaid, as in other cases mentioned, but those of a nurse. Her
conduct on being offered a gown is exactly that of the brownie
similarly placed: see p. 109 above. But she and Bwca&rsquo;r Trwyn are
unmistakably fairies who take to domestic service, and work for a time
willingly and well in return for their food, which, as in the case of
other fairies, appears to have been mostly milk.</p>
<p>After this digression I wish only to point out that the Welsh
bogie&rsquo;s name, Gwarwyn-a-throt, treated as Welsh, could only mean
<i>white-necked and</i> (or <i>with</i>) <i>a trot</i>; for <i>a
throt</i> could only mean &lsquo;and (<i>or</i> with) a trot.&rsquo; So
it is clear that <i>a throt</i> is simply the equivalent of a-Trot,
borrowed from such an English combination as Trit-a-Trot, and that it
is idle to translate Gwarwyn-a-throt. Now <i>trot</i> and <i>twt</i>
are not native Welsh words; and the same remark applies to <i>Trwtyn
Tratyn</i>, and of course to <i>S&igrave;li ffrit</i> and
<i>S&igrave;li go Dwt</i>. Hence it is natural to infer that either
these names have in the Welsh stories merely superseded older ones of
Welsh origin, or else that there was no question of name in the Welsh
stories till they had come under English influence. The former
conjecture seems the more probable of the two, unless one should rather
suppose the whole story borrowed from English sources. But it is of no
consequence here as regards the reluctance <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb598" href="#v2pb598" name=
"v2pb598">598</a>]</span>of fairies to disclose their names; for we
have other instances to which the reader may turn, on pp. 45,
87&ndash;8, 97 above. One of them, in particular, is in point here: see
pp. 54, 61. It attaches itself to the Pool of Corwrion in the
neighbourhood of Bangor; and it relates how a man married a fairy on
the express condition that he was neither to know her name nor to touch
her with iron, on pain of her instantly leaving him. Of course in the
lapse of years the conditions are accidentally violated by the luckless
husband, and the wife flies instantly away into the waters of the pool:
her name turned out to be Belene.</p>
<p>Thus far of the unwillingness of the fairies to tell their names: I
must now come to the question, why that was so. Here the anthropologist
or the student of comparative folklore comes to our aid; for it is an
important part of his business to compare the superstitions of one
people with those of another; and in the case of superstitions which
have lost their meaning among us, for instance, he searches for a
parallel among other nations, where that parallel forms part of living
institutions. In this way he hopes to discover the key to his
difficulties. In the present case he finds savages who habitually look
at the name as part and parcel of the person<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e20745src" href="#xd26e20745" name="xd26e20745src">44</a>. These
savages further believe that any part of the person, such as a hair off
one&rsquo;s head or the parings of one&rsquo;s nails, if they chanced
to be found by an enemy, would give that enemy magical power over their
lives, and enable him to injure them. Hence the savage tendency to
conceal one&rsquo;s name. I have here, as the reader will perceive,
crowded together several important steps in the savage logic; so I must
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb599" href="#v2pb599" name=
"v2pb599">599</a>]</span>try to illustrate them, somewhat more in
detail, by reference to some of the survivals of them after the savage
has long been civilized. To return to Wales, and to illustrate the
belief that possession of a part of one&rsquo;s person, or of anything
closely identified with one&rsquo;s person, gives the possessor of it
power over that person, I need only recall the Welsh notion, that if
one wished to sell one&rsquo;s self to the devil one had merely to give
him a hair of one&rsquo;s head or the tiniest drop of one&rsquo;s
blood, then one would be for ever his for a temporary consideration.
Again, if you only had your hair cut, it must be carefully gathered and
hidden away: by no means must it be burnt, as that might prove
prejudicial to your health. Similarly, you should never throw feathers
into the fire; for that was once held, as I infer, to bring about death
among one&rsquo;s poultry: and an old relative of mine, <i>Modryb
Mari</i>, &lsquo;Aunt Mary,&rsquo; set her face against my taste for
toasted cheese. She used to tell me that if I toasted my cheese, my
sheep would waste away and die: strictly speaking, I fancy this
originally meant only the sheep from whose milk the cheese had been
made. But I was not well versed enough in the doctrines of sympathetic
magic to reply, that it did not apply to our cheese, which was not made
from sheep&rsquo;s milk. So her warning used to frighten me and check
my fondness for toasted cheese, a fondness which I had doubtless quite
innocently inherited, as anybody will see who will glance at one of the
<i>Hundred Mery Talys</i>, printed by John Rastell in the sixteenth
century, as follows:&mdash;&lsquo;I fynde wrytten amonge olde gestes,
howe God mayde Saynt Peter porter of heuen, and that God of hys
goodnes, sone after his passyon, suffered many men to come to the
kyngdome of Heuen with small deseruynge; at whyche tyme there was in
heuen a great companye of Welchemen, whyche with their crakynge and
babelynge <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb600" href="#v2pb600" name=
"v2pb600">600</a>]</span>troubled all the other. Wherfore God sayde to
Saynte Peter that he was wery of them, and that he wolde fayne haue
them out of heuen. To whome Saynte Peter sayd: Good Lorde, I warrente
you, that shall be done. Wherfore Saynt Peter wente out of heuen gates
and cryed wyth a loud voyce <i>Cause bobe</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e20764src" href="#xd26e20764" name="xd26e20764src">45</a>, that is
as moche to saye as rosted chese, whiche thynge the Welchemen herynge,
ranne out of Heuen a great pace. And when Saynt Peter sawe them all
out, he sodenly wente into Heuen, and locked the dore, and so sparred
all the Welchemen out. By this ye may se, that it is no wysdome for a
man to loue or to set his mynde to moche upon any delycate or worldely
pleasure, wherby he shall lose the celestyall and eternall
ioye.&rsquo;</p>
<p>To leave the <i>Mery Talys</i> and come back to the instances
mentioned, all of them may be said to illustrate the way in which a
part, or an adjunct, answered for the whole of a person or thing. In
fact, having due regard to magic as an exact science, an exceedingly
exact science, one may say that according to the wisdom of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb601" href="#v2pb601" name=
"v2pb601">601</a>]</span>our ancestors the leading axiom of that
science practically amounted to this: the part is quite equal to the
whole. Now the name, as a part of the man, was once probably identified
with the breath of life or with the soul, as we shall see later; and
the latter must have been regarded as a kind of matter; for I well
remember that when a person was dying in a house, it was the custom
about Ponterwyd, in North Cardiganshire, to open the windows. And a
farmer near Ystrad Meurig, more towards the south of the county, told
me some years ago that he remembered his mother dying when he was a
boy: a neighbour&rsquo;s wife who had been acting as nurse tried to
open the window of the room, and as it would not open she deliberately
smashed a pane of it. This was doubtless originally meant to facilitate
the escape of the soul; and the same idea has been attested for
Gloucestershire, Devon, and other parts of the country<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e20799src" href="#xd26e20799" name=
"xd26e20799src">46</a>. This way of looking at the soul reminds one of
Professor Tylor&rsquo;s words when he wrote in his work on <i>Primitive
Culture</i>, i. 440: &lsquo;and he who says that his spirit goes forth
to meet a friend, can still realize in the phrase a meaning deeper than
metaphor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then if the soul was material, you may ask what its shape was; and
even this I have a story which will answer: it comes from the same
Modryb Mari who set her face against <i>caws pobi</i>, and cherished a
good many superstitions. Therein she differed greatly from her sister,
my mother, who had a far more logical mind and a clearer conception of
things. Well, my aunt&rsquo;s story was to the following
effect:&mdash;A party of reapers on a farm not far from
Ponterwyd&mdash;I have forgotten the name&mdash;sat down in the field
to their midday meal. Afterwards they rested awhile, when one of their
number fell fast asleep. The others got up and began <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb602" href="#v2pb602" name=
"v2pb602">602</a>]</span>reaping again, glancing every now and then at
the sleeping man, who had his mouth wide open and breathed very loudly.
Presently they saw a little black man, or something like a monkey,
coming out of his mouth and starting on a walk round the field: they
watched this little fellow walking on and on till he came to a spot
near a stream. There he stopped and turned back: then he disappeared
into the open mouth of the sleeper, who at once woke up. He told his
comrades that he had just been dreaming of his walking round the field
as far as the very spot where they had seen the little black fellow
stop. I am sorry to say that Modryb Mari had wholly forgotten this
story when, years afterwards, I asked her to repeat it to me; but the
other day I found a Welshman who still remembers it. I happened to
complain, at a meeting of kindred spirits, how I had neglected making
careful notes of bits of folklore which I had heard years ago from
informants whom I had since been unable to cross-examine: I instanced
the story of the sleeping reaper, when my friend Professor Sayce at
once said that he had heard it. He spent part of his childhood near
&#7930;anover in Monmouthshire; and in those days he spoke Welsh, which
he learned from his nurse. He added that he well remembered the late
Lady &#7930;anover rebuking his father for having his child, a Welsh
boy, dressed like a little Highlander; and he remembered also hearing
the story here in question told him by his nurse. So far as he could
recall it, the version was the same as my aunt&rsquo;s, except that he
does not recollect hearing anything about the stream of water.</p>
<p>Several points in the story call for notice: among others, one
naturally asks at the outset why the other reapers did not wake the
sleeping man. The answer is that the Welsh seem to have agreed with
other <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb603" href="#v2pb603" name=
"v2pb603">603</a>]</span>peoples, such as the Irish<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e20819src" href="#xd26e20819" name="xd26e20819src">47</a>, in
thinking it dangerous to wake a man when dreaming, that is, when his
soul might be wandering outside his body; for it might result in the
soul failing to find the way back into the body which it had
temporarily left. To illustrate this from Wales I produce the following
story, which has been written out for me by Mr. J. G. Evans. The scene
of it was a field on the farm of Cadabowen, near &#7930;an y
By&#273;air, in the Vale of the Teifi:&mdash;&lsquo;The chief point of
the <i>madfa&#7931;</i> incident, which happened in the early sixties,
was this. During one mid-morning <i>hoe hogi</i>, that is to say, the
usual rest for sharpening the reaping-hooks, I was playing among the
thirty or forty reapers sitting together: my movements were probably a
disturbing element to the reapers, as well as a source of danger to my
own limbs. In order, therefore, to quiet me, as seems probable, one of
the men directed my attention to our old farm labourer, who was asleep
on his back close to the uncut corn, a little apart from the others. I
was told that his soul (<i>ened</i>) had gone out of his mouth in the
form of a black lizard (<i>madfa&#7931; &#273;u</i>), and was at that
moment wandering among the standing corn. If I woke the sleeper, the
soul would be unable to return; and old Thomas would die, or go crazy;
or something serious would happen. I will not trust my memory to fill
in details, especially as this incident once formed the basis of what
proved an exciting story told to my children in their childhood. A
generation hence <i>they</i> may be able to give an astonishing
instance of &ldquo;genuine&rdquo; Welsh folklore. In the meanwhile, I
can <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb604" href="#v2pb604" name=
"v2pb604">604</a>]</span>bear testimony to that &ldquo;black
lizard&rdquo; being about the most living impression in my
&ldquo;memory.&rdquo; I see it, even now, wriggling at the edge of the
uncut corn. But as to its return, and the waking of the sleeper, my
memory is a blank. Such are the tricks of &ldquo;memory&rdquo;; and we
should be charitable when, with bated breath, the educated no less than
the uneducated tell us about the uncanny things they have &ldquo;seen
with their own eyes.&rdquo; They believe what they say, because they
trust their memory: I do not. I feel practically certain I never saw a
lizard in my life, in that particular field in which the reapers
were.&rsquo; Mr. Evans&rsquo; story differs, as it has been seen, from
my aunt&rsquo;s version in giving the soul the shape of a lizard; but
the little black fellow in the one and the black lizard in the other
agree not only in representing the soul as material, but also as
forming a complete organism within a larger one. In a word, both
pictures must be regarded as the outcome of attempts to depict the
sleeper&rsquo;s inner man.</p>
<p>If names and souls could be regarded as material substances, so
could diseases; and I wish to say a word or two now on that subject,
which a short story of my wife&rsquo;s will serve to introduce. She is
a native of the &#7930;anberis side of Snowdon; and she remembers going
one morning, when a small child, across to the neighbourhood of
Rhyd-&#273;u with a servant girl called Cadi, whose parents lived
there. Now Cadi was a very good servant, but she had little regard for
the more civilized manners of the &#7930;anberis folk; and when she
returned with the child in the evening from her mother&rsquo;s cottage,
she admitted that the little girl was amazed at the language of
Cadi&rsquo;s brothers and sisters; for she confessed that, as she said,
they swore like colliers, whereas the little girl had never before
heard any swearing worth speaking of. Well, among other things which
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb605" href="#v2pb605" name=
"v2pb605">605</a>]</span>little girl saw there was one of Cadi&rsquo;s
sisters having a bad leg dressed: when the rag which had been on the
wound was removed, the mother made one of her other children take it
out and fix it on the thorn growing near the door. The little girl
being inquisitive asked why that was done, and she was told that it was
in order that the wound might heal all the faster. She was not very
satisfied with the answer, but she afterwards noticed the same sort of
thing done in her own neighbourhood. Now the original idea was
doubtless that the disease, or at any rate a part of it&mdash;and in
such matters it will be remembered that a part is quite equal to the
whole&mdash;was attached to the rag; so that putting the rag out, with
a part of the disease attached to it, to rot on the bush, would bring
with it the disappearance of the whole disease.</p>
<p>Another and a wider aspect of this practice was the subject of
notice in the chapter on the Folklore of the Wells, pp. 359&ndash;60,
where Mr. Hartland&rsquo;s hypothesis was mentioned. This was to the
effect that if any clothing, or anything else which had been identified
with your person, were to be placed in contact with a sacred tree,
sacred well, or sacred edifice, it would be involved in the effluence
of the divinity that imparts its sacred character to the tree, well, or
temple; and that your person, identified with the clothing or other
article, would also be involved or soaked in the same divine effluence,
and made to benefit thereby. We have since had this kind of reasoning
illustrated, pp. 405&ndash;7 above, by the modern legend of Crymlyn,
and the old one of &#7930;yn &#7930;iwan; but the difficulty which it
involves is a very considerable one: it is the difficulty of taking
seriously the infantile order of reasoning which underlies so much of
the philosophy of folklore. I cannot readily forget one of the first
occasions of my coming, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb606" href=
"#v2pb606" name="v2pb606">606</a>]</span>so to say, into living contact
with it. It was at Tuam in Connaught, whither I had gone to learn
modern Irish from the late Canon Ulick J. Bourke. There one day in 1871
he presented me with a copy of <i>The Bull &lsquo;Ineffabilis&rsquo; in
Four Languages</i> (Dublin, 1868), containing the Irish version which
he had himself contributed. On the blue cover was a gilt picture of the
Virgin, inscribed <i lang="la">Sine Labe Concepta</i>. No sooner had I
brought it to my lodgings than the woman who looked after the house
caught sight of it. She was at once struck with awe and admiration; so
I tried to explain to her the nature of the contents of the volume.
&lsquo;So the Father has given you that holy book!&rsquo; she
exclaimed; &lsquo;and you are now a holy man!&rsquo; I was astonished
at the simple and easy way in which she believed holiness could be
transferred from one person or thing to another; and it has always
helped me to realize the fact that folklorists have no occasion to
invent their people, or to exaggerate the childish features of their
minds. They are still with us as real men and real women, and at one
time the whole world belonged to them; not to mention that those who
may, by a straining of courtesy, be called their leaders of thought,
hope speedily to reannex the daring few who are trying to tear asunder
the bonds forged for mankind in the obscurity of a distant past. I
shall never forget the impression made on my mind by a sermon I heard
preached some years later in the cathedral of St. Stephen in Vienna.
That magnificent edifice in a great centre of German culture was
crowded with listeners, who seemed thoroughly to enjoy what they heard,
though the chief idea which they were asked to entertain could not
possibly be said to rise above the level of the philosophy of the Stone
Age. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb607" href="#v2pb607" name=

Professor J. Morris Jones, to whom I am indebted for the particulars
connected with these names, informs me that the local pronunciation is

Amlwch, it was always sounded <i>Dar&oacute;nwy</i>. The Professor also
tells me that <i>Dernog</i> is never made into <i>Dyrnog</i>: the

Serrigi, Serigi, or Syrigi looks like a Latin genitive torn out of its
context, but derived in the last resort from the Norse name
<i>Sigtrygg-r</i>, which the Four Masters give as <i>Sitriucc</i> or
<i>Sitriug</i>: see their entries from 891 to 1091. The Scandinavians
of Dublin and its neighbourhood were addicted to descents on the shores
of North Wales; and we have possibly a trace of occupation by them in
<i>Gaue&#7931; Seirith</i>, &lsquo;Seirith&rsquo;s holding,&rsquo; in
the <i>Record of Carnarvon</i>, p. 63, where the place in question is
represented as being in the manor of Cemmaes, in Anglesey. The name
Seirith was probably that written by the Four Masters as <i>Sichfraith
Sichraidh</i> (also <i>Serridh</i>, <span class="sc">A. D.</span> 971),
that is to say the Norse <i>Sigr&aelig;&#273;-r</i> before it lost the
<i>f</i> retained in its German equivalent <i>Siegfried</i>. We seem to
detect <i>Seirith</i> later as <i>Seri</i> in place-names in
Anglesey&mdash;as for example in the name of the farms called <i>Seri
Fawr</i> and <i>Seri Bach</i> between &#7930;andrygarn and
&#7930;annerch y Me&#273;, also in a <i>Pen Seri</i>,
&lsquo;Seri&rsquo;s Knoll or Hill,&rsquo; at Bryn Du, near Ty Croes
station, and in another <i>Pen Seri</i> on Holyhead Island, between
Holyhead and &#7930;ain Goch, on the way to the South Stack. Lastly
Dugdale, v. 672<sup>b</sup> mentions a <i>Claud Seri</i>,
&lsquo;Seri&rsquo;s Dyke or Ditch,&rsquo; as being somewhere in the
neighbourhood of &#7930;anwnda, in Carnarvonshire&mdash;not very far
perhaps from the Gwyrfai and the spot where the <i>Iolo MSS.</i> (pp.
81&ndash;2) represent Serrigi repulsed by Caswa&#7931;on and driven
back to Anglesey, previous to his being crushed at Cerrig y
Gwy&#273;yl. The reader must, however, be warned that the modern
<i>Seri</i> is sometimes pronounced <i>Si&#815;eri</i> or <i>Sheri</i>,
which suggests the possibility of some of the instances involving
rather a form of the English word <i>sheriff</i>.&nbsp;<a class=

Several passages bearing on the word <i>bannog</i> have been brought
together in Silvan Evans&rsquo; <i>Geiriadur</i>. He gives the meaning
as &lsquo;high, lofty, prominent, conspicuous.&rsquo; The word is
derived from <i>ban</i>, &lsquo;a summit or peak,&rsquo; plural
<i>bannau</i>, so common in the names of hills and mountains in South
Wales&mdash;as in <i>y Fan</i> in Carmarthenshire, <i>Bannwchdeni</i>
(p. 22) in Breconshire, <i>Pen y Bannau</i> near Pont Rhyd Fendigaid in
Cardiganshire, <i>Bannau Brycheiniog</i> and <i>Bannau Sir Gaer</i>,
the mountains called in English the Beacons of Breconshire and
Carmarthenshire respectively. In North Wales we have it possibly in the
compound <i>Tryfan</i>, which the mapsters will have us call
<i>Tryfaen</i>; and the corresponding word in Scotch Gaelic appears in
such names as <i>Ben Nevis</i> and the like, while in Irish the word
<i>benn</i> meant a horn or peak. I am, nevertheless, not at all sure
that <i>Ychen Bannog</i> meant horned oxen or even tall and conspicuous
oxen; for there is a Welsh word <i>man</i>, meaning a spot or mark
(Latin <i>menda</i>), and the adjective was <i>mannawc</i>,
<i>mannog</i>, &lsquo;spotted, marked, particoloured.&rsquo; Now in the
soft mutation all four words&mdash;<i>ban</i>, <i>bannog</i>, and
<i>man</i>, <i>mannog</i>&mdash;would begin with <i>f</i> = <i>v</i>,
which might help to confusion between them. This may be illustrated in
a way from Williams&rsquo; <i>Seint Greal</i> (pp. 88&ndash;92), where
Gwalchmai has a dream in which he sees 150 bulls with spots or patches
of colour on them, except three only which were &lsquo;without any spot
in the world&rsquo; (neb ryw <i>vann</i> or byt), or as it is also put
&lsquo;without spot&rsquo; (heb <i>vann</i>). This word <i>vann</i>,
applied to the colour of the bulls, comes from the radical form
<i>mann</i>; and the adjective was <i>mannawc</i> or <i>mannog</i>,
which would mean spotted, particoloured, or having patches of colour.
Now the oxen of Welsh legends are also sometimes called <i>Ychen
Mannog</i> (pp. 131&ndash;2), and it is possible, that, whichever way
the term is written, it should be interpreted to mean spotted, marked,
or particoloured oxen. I take it also that <i>&#7930;an &#272;ewi Frefi
fraith</i> was meant as synonymous with <i>&#7930;an &#272;ewi Frefi
fannog</i>, which did not fit the rhyme. Lastly, the Dyfed use of the
saying <i>Fel dau ych bannog</i>, &lsquo;Like two <i>Bannog</i>
oxen,&rsquo; in the sense of &lsquo;equal and inseparable
companions&rsquo; (as instanced in the <i>Geiriadur</i>), sounds like
the antithesis of the passage in the Kulhwch (<i>Mabinogion</i>, p.
121). For there we have words to the following effect: &lsquo;Though
thou shouldst get that, there is something which thou wilt not get,
namely the two oxen of Bannog, the one on the other side of the
<i>Bannog</i> mountain and the other on this side, and to bring them
together to draw the same plough. They are, to wit, Nynio and Peibio,
whom God fashioned into oxen for their sins.&rsquo; Here the difficulty
contemplated was not to separate the two, but to bring them together to
work under the same yoke. This is more in harmony with the story of the
mad quarrel between the two brother kings bearing those names as
mentioned above.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

word <i>twt</i>, &lsquo;tidy,&rsquo; is another vocable which has found
its way into Wales from the western counties of England; and though its
meaning is more universally that of &lsquo;tidy or natty,&rsquo; the
term <i>gwas twt</i>, which in North Cardiganshire means a youth who is
ready to run on all kinds of errands, would seem to bring us to its
earlier meaning of the French <i>tout</i>&mdash;as if <i>gwas twt</i>
might be rendered a &lsquo;<i lang="fr">gar&ccedil;on &agrave;
tout</i>&rsquo;&mdash;which survives as <i>tote</i> in the counties of
Gloucester and Hereford, as I am informed by Professor Wright.
Possibly, however, one may prefer to connect <i>twt</i> with the
nautical English word <i>taut</i>; but we want more light. In any case
one may venture to say that colloquial Welsh swarms with words whose

Welsh spelling is <i>caws pob</i>, &lsquo;baked (or roasted)
cheese,&rsquo; so called in parts of South Wales, such as
Carmarthenshire, whereas in North Wales it is <i>caws pobi</i>. It is
best known to Englishmen as &lsquo;Welsh rabbit,&rsquo; which superior
persons &lsquo;ruling the roast&rsquo; in our kitchens choose to make
into <i>rarebit</i>: how they would deal with &lsquo;Scotch
woodcock&rsquo; and &lsquo;Oxford hare,&rsquo; I do not know. I should
have mentioned that copies of the <i>Hundred Mery Talys</i> are
exceedingly scarce, and that the above, which is the seventy-sixth in
the collection, has here been copied from the <i>Cymmrodor</i>, iii.
115&ndash;6, where we have the following sapient
note:&mdash;&lsquo;<i>Cause bobe</i>, it will be observed, is St.
Peter&rsquo;s rendering of the phrase <i lang="cy">Caws wedi ei
bobi</i>. The chief of the Apostles apparently had only a rather
imperfect knowledge of Welsh, which is not to be wondered at, as we
know that even his Hebrew was far from giving satisfaction to the
priests of the capital.&rsquo; From these words one can only say that
St. Peter would seem to have known Welsh far better than the author of
that note, and that he had acquired it from natives of South Wales,
perhaps from the neighbourhood of Kidwelly. I have to thank my friend
Mr. James Cotton for a version of the cheese story in the Bodleian
Library, namely in Malone MS. 19 (p. 144), where a certain master at

<p class="first">It will be remembered that in the last chapter a story
was given, p. 602, which represented the soul as a little fellow
somewhat resembling a monkey; and it will probably have struck the
reader how near this approaches the idea prevalent in medieval theology
and Christian art, which pictured the soul as a pigmy or diminutive
human being. I revert to this in order to point out that the Christian
fancy may possibly have given rise to the form of the soul as
represented in the Welsh story which I heard in Cardiganshire and
Professor Sayce in Monmouthshire; but this could hardly be regarded as
touching the other Cardiganshire story, in which the soul is likened to
a <i>madfa&#7931;</i> or lizard. Moreover I would point out that a
belief incompatible with both kinds of story is suggested by one of the
uses of the Welsh word for soul, namely, <i>enaid</i>. I heard my
father, a native of the neighbourhood of Eglwys Fach, near the estuary
of the Dyfi, use the word of some portion of the inside of a goose, but
I have forgotten what part it was exactly. Professor Anwyl of
Aberystwyth, however, has sent me the following communication on the
subject:&mdash;&lsquo;I am quite familiar with the expression <i>yr
enaid</i>, &ldquo;the soul,&rdquo; as applied to the soft flesh
sticking to the ribs inside a goose. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb608" href="#v2pb608" name="v2pb608">608</a>]</span>flesh in
question has somewhat the same appearance and structure as the liver. I
have no recollection of ever hearing the term <i>yr enaid</i> used in
the case of any bird other than a goose; but this may be a mere
accident, inasmuch as no one ever uses the term now except to mention
it as an interesting curiosity.&rsquo; This application of the word
<i>enaid</i> recalls the use of the English word &lsquo;soul&rsquo; in
the same way, and points to a very crude idea of the soul as material
and only forming an internal portion of the body: it is on the low
level of the notion of an English pagan of the seventeenth century who
thought his soul was &lsquo;a great bone in his body<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e20897src" href="#xd26e20897" name=
"xd26e20897src">1</a>.&rsquo; It is, however, not quite so foolish,
perhaps, as it looks at first sight; and it reminds one of the
Mohammedan belief that the <i>os coccygis</i> is the first formed in
the human body, and that it will remain uncorrupted till the last day
as a seed from which the whole is to be renewed in the
resurrection<a class="noteref" id="xd26e20906src" href="#xd26e20906"
name="xd26e20906src">2</a>.</p>
<p>On either savage theory, that the soul is a material organism inside
a bulkier organism, or the still lower one that it is an internal
portion of the larger organism itself, the idea of death would be
naturally much the same, namely, that it was what occurred when the
body and the soul became permanently severed. I call attention to this
because we have traces in Welsh literature of a very different notion
of death, which must now be briefly explained. The <i>Mabinogi</i> of
Math ab Mathonwy relates how Math and Gwydion made out of various
flowers a most beautiful woman whom they named Blodeuwe&#273;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e20917src" href="#xd26e20917" name=
"xd26e20917src">3</a>, that is to say <span class="trans" title=

flowerlike, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb609" href="#v2pb609"
name="v2pb609">609</a>]</span>and gave to wife to &#7930;ew
&#7930;awgyffes; how she, as it were to prove what consummate artists
they had been, behaved forthwith like a woman of the ordinary origin,
in that she fell in love with another man named Gronw Pebyr of
Pen&#7931;yn; and how she plotted with Gronw as to the easiest way to
put her husband to death. Pretending to be greatly concerned about the
welfare of &#7930;ew and very anxious to take measures against his
death (<i>angheu</i>), she succeeded in finding from him in what manner
one could kill (<i>&#7931;a&#273;</i>) him. His reply was,
&lsquo;Unless God kill me &hellip; it is not easy to kill me&rsquo;;
and he went on to describe the strange attitude in which he might be
killed, namely, in a certain position when dressing after a bath: then,
he said, if one cast a spear at him it would effect his death
(<i>angheu</i>), but that spear must have been a whole year in the
making, during the hour only when the sacrifice was proceeding on
Sunday. Blodeuwe&#273; thanked heaven, she said, to find that all this
was easy to avoid. But still her curiosity was not satisfied; so one
day she induced &#7930;ew to go into the bath and show exactly what he
meant. Of course she had Gronw with his enchanted spear in readiness,
and at the proper moment, when &#7930;ew was dressing after the bath,
the paramour cast his spear at him. He hit him in the side, so that the
head of the spear remained in &#7930;ew, whilst the shaft fell off:
&#7930;ew flew away in the form of an eagle, uttering an unearthly cry.
He was no more seen until Gwydion, searching for him far and wide in
Powys and Gwyne&#273;, came to Arfon, where one day he followed the
lead of a mysterious sow, until the beast stopped under an oak at
Nant&#7931;e. There Gwydion found the sow devouring rotten flesh and
maggots, which fell from an eagle whenever the bird shook himself at
the top of the tree. He suspected this was &#7930;ew, and on singing
three englyns <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb610" href="#v2pb610"
name="v2pb610">610</a>]</span>to him the eagle came lower and lower,
till at last he descended on Gwydion&rsquo;s lap. Then Gwydion struck
him with his wand, so that he assumed his own shape of &#7930;ew
&#7930;awgyffes, and nobody ever saw a more wretched looking man, we
are told: he was nothing but skin and bones. But the best medical aid
that could be found in Gwyne&#273; was procured, and before the end of
the year he was quite well again.</p>
<p>Here it will be noticed, that though the fatal wounding of
&#7930;ew, at any rate visibly, means his being changed into the form
of an eagle, it is treated as his death. When the <i>Mabinogion</i>
were edited in their present form in a later atmosphere, this sort of
phraseology was not natural to the editor, and he shows it when he
comes to relate how Gwydion punished Blodeuwe&#273;, as
follows:&mdash;Gwydion, having overtaken her in her flight, is made to
say, &lsquo;I shall not kill thee (<i lang="cy">Ny la&#273;af i
di</i>): I shall do what is worse for thee, and that is to let thee go
in the form of a bird.&rsquo; He let her go in fact in the form of an
owl. According to the analogy of the other part of the story this meant
his having killed her: it was her death, and the words &lsquo;I shall
not kill thee&rsquo; are presumably not to be regarded as belonging to
the original story. To come back to the eagle, later Welsh literature,
re-echoing probably an ancient notion, speaks of a nephew of Arthur,
called Eliwlod, appearing to Arthur as an eagle seated likewise among
the branches of an oak. He claims acquaintance and kinship with Arthur,
but he has to explain to him that he has died: they have a
dialogue<a class="noteref" id="xd26e20950src" href="#xd26e20950" name=
"xd26e20950src">4</a> in the course of which the eagle gives Arthur
some serious Christian advice. But we <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb611" href="#v2pb611" name="v2pb611">611</a>]</span>have in this
sort of idea doubtless the kind of origin to which one might expect to
trace the prophesying eagle, such as Geoffrey mentions more than once:
see his <i lang="la">Historia</i>, ii. 9 and xii. 18<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e20968src" href="#xd26e20968" name="xd26e20968src">5</a>. Add
to these instances of transformation the belief prevalent in Cornwall
almost to our own day, that Arthur himself, instead of dying, was
merely changed by magic into a raven, a form in which he still goes
about; so that a Cornishman will not wittingly fire at a raven<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e20974src" href="#xd26e20974" name=
"xd26e20974src">6</a>. This sort of transformation is not to be severed
from instances supplied by Irish literature, such as the story of Tuan
mac Cairill, related in the <i>Book of the Dun Cow</i>, fo.
15<sup>a</sup>&ndash;16<sup>b</sup>. Tuan relates to St. Finnen of
Magbile, in the sixth century, the early history of Ireland from the
time of Partholan down, which he was enabled to do because he had lived
through it all, passing from one form to another without losing his
memory. First of all he was a man, and when old age had come upon him
he was transformed into a stag of the forest. For a while he was
youthful and vigorous; but again old age overtook him, and he next
became a wild boar. When old age and decrepitude overcame him next he
was renewed in the form of a powerful bird, called in the original
<i>seig</i>. The next renewal was in the form of a salmon: here the
manuscript fails us. The form of a salmon was also the one taken by the
woman Liban when she was overwhelmed by the flood, which became the
body of water known as Lough Neagh: her handmaid at the same time
became an otter (fo. 40<sup>b</sup>). There was an ancient belief that
the soul leaves the body like a bird flying out of the mouth of the man
or woman dying, and this maybe said to approach the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb612" href="#v2pb612" name=
"v2pb612">612</a>]</span>favourite Celtic notion illustrated by the
transformations here instanced, to which may be added the case of the
Children of Lir, pp. 93, 549, changed by the stroke of their wicked
stepmother&rsquo;s wand into swans, on Lough Erne. The story has, in
the course of ages, modified itself into a belief that the swans
haunting that beautiful water at all seasons of the year, are the souls
of holy women who fell victims to the repeated visitations of the pagan
Norsemen, when Ireland was at their cruel mercy<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e20998src" href="#xd26e20998" name="xd26e20998src">7</a>. The
Christian form which the Irish peasant has given the legend does not
touch its relevancy here. Perhaps one might venture to generalize, that
in these islands great men and women were believed to continue their
existence in the form of eagles, hawks or ravens, swans or owls. But
what became of the souls of the obscurer majority of the people? For an
answer to this perhaps we can only fall back on the Psyche butterfly,
which may here be illustrated by the fact that Cornish tradition
applies the term &lsquo;pisky&rsquo; both to the fairies and to moths,
believed in Cornwall by many to be departed souls<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e21004src" href="#xd26e21004" name="xd26e21004src">8</a>. So in
Ireland: a certain reverend gentleman named Joseph Ferguson, writing in
1810 a statistical account of the parish of Ballymoyer, in the county
of Armagh, states that one day a girl chasing a butterfly was chid by
her companions, who said to her: &lsquo;That may be the soul of your
grandmother<a class="noteref" id="xd26e21016src" href="#xd26e21016"
name="xd26e21016src">9</a>.&rsquo; This idea, to survive, has modified
itself into a belief less objectionably pagan, that a butterfly
hovering near a corpse is a sign of its everlasting happiness.</p>
<p>The shape-shifting is sometimes complicated by taking place on the
lines of rebirth: as cases in point <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb613" href="#v2pb613" name="v2pb613">613</a>]</span>may be
mentioned Lug, reborn as C&uacute;chulainn<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e21023src" href="#xd26e21023" name="xd26e21023src">10</a>, and the
repeated births of &Eacute;t&aacute;in. This was rendered possible in
the case of C&uacute;chulainn, for instance, by Lug taking the form of
an insect which was unwittingly swallowed by Dechtere, who thereby
became C&uacute;chulainn&rsquo;s mother; and so in the case of
&Eacute;t&aacute;in<a class="noteref" id="xd26e21035src" href=
"#xd26e21035" name="xd26e21035src">11</a> and her last recorded mother,
the queen of Etar king of Eochraidhe. On Welsh ground we have a
combination of transformations and rebirth in the history of Gwion Bach
in the story of Taliessin. Gwion was in the service of the witch
Ceridwen; but having learned too much of her arts, he became the object
of her lasting hatred; and the incident is translated as follows in
Lady Charlotte Guest&rsquo;s <i>Mabinogion</i>, iii.
358&ndash;9:&mdash;&lsquo;And she went forth after him, running. And he
saw her, and changed himself into a hare and fled. But she changed
herself into a greyhound and turned him. And he ran towards a river,
and became a fish. And she in the form of an otter-bitch chased him
under the water, until he was fain to turn himself into a bird of the
air. Then she, as a hawk, followed him and gave him no rest in the sky.
And just as she was about to swoop upon him, and he was in fear of
death, he espied a heap of winnowed wheat on the floor of a barn, and
he dropped amongst the wheat, and turned himself into one of the
grains. Then she transformed herself into a high-crested black hen, and
went to the wheat and scratched it with her feet, and found him out and
swallowed him. And, as the story says, she bore him nine months, and
when she was delivered of him, she could not find it in her heart
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb614" href="#v2pb614" name=
"v2pb614">614</a>]</span>to kill him, by reason of his beauty. So she
wrapped him in a leathern bag, and cast him into the sea to the mercy
of God on the twenty-ninth day of April. And at that time the weir of
Gwy&#273;no was on the strand between Dyvi and Aberystwyth, near to his
own castle, and the value of an hundred pounds was taken in that weir
every May eve.&rsquo; The story goes on to relate how
Gwy&#273;no&rsquo;s son, Elphin, found in the weir the leathern bag
containing the baby, who grew up to be the bard Taliessin. But the
fourteenth century manuscript called after the name of Taliessin teems
with such transformations as the above, except that they are by no
means confined to the range of the animal and vegetable kingdoms. I
heard an amusing suggestion of metempsychosis the other day: it is
related of a learned German, who was sitting at table, let us say, in
an Oxford hotel, with most of his dinner in front of him. Being,
however, a man of immediate foresight, and anxious to accustom himself
to fine English, he was not to be restrained by scruples as to any
possible discrepancy between words like <i lang="de">bekommen</i> and
<i>become</i>. So to the astonishment of everybody he gravely called
out to the waiter, &lsquo;Hereafter I vish to become a Velsh
rabbit.&rsquo; This would have done admirably for the author of certain
poems in the <i>Book of Taliessin</i>, where the bard&rsquo;s changes
are dwelt upon. From them it appears that the transformation might be
into anything that the mind of man could in any way individualize. Thus
Taliessin claims to have been, some time or other, not only a stag or a
salmon, but also an axe, a sword, and even a book in a priest&rsquo;s
hand, or a word in writing. On the whole, however, his history as a
grain of corn has most interest here, as it differs from that which has
just been given: the passage<a class="noteref" id="xd26e21068src" href=
"#xd26e21068" name="xd26e21068src">12</a> is sadly obscure, but
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb615" href="#v2pb615" name=
"v2pb615">615</a>]</span>I understand it to say that the grain was duly
sown on a hill, that it was reaped and finally brought on the hearth,
where the ears of corn were emptied of their grains by the ancient
method of dexterously applying a flame to them<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e21079src" href="#xd26e21079" name="xd26e21079src">13</a>. But
while the light was being applied the grain which was Taliessin,
falling from the operator&rsquo;s hand, was quickly received and
swallowed by a hostile hen, in whose interior it remained nine nights;
but though this seemingly makes Taliessin&rsquo;s mother a bird, he
speaks of himself, without mentioning any intervening transformation,
as a <i>gwas</i> or young man. Such an origin was perhaps never meant
to be other than incomprehensible. Lastly as to rebirth, I may say that
it has often struck me that the Welsh habit, especially common in
Carnarvonshire and Anglesey, of one child in a family being named,
partially or wholly, after a grandparent, is to be regarded as a trace
of the survival from early times of a belief in such atavism as has
been suggested above<a class="noteref" id="xd26e21092src" href=
"#xd26e21092" name="xd26e21092src">14</a>.</p>
<p>The belief in transformations or transmigrations, such as have been
mentioned, must have lent itself to various developments, and two at
least of them are deserving of some notice here. First may be mentioned
one which connects itself intimately with the druid or magician: he is
master of his own transformations, as in the case of Ceridwen and
Gwion, for he had acquired his magic by tasting of the contents of
Ceridwen&rsquo;s Cauldron of Sciences, and he retained his memory
continuously through his shape-shiftings, as is best illustrated,
perhaps, by the case of Tuan mac Cairill. The next step was for him to
realize his changes, not as matters of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb616" href="#v2pb616" name=
"v2pb616">616</a>]</span>past but as present and possible; in fact, to
lay claim to being anybody or anything he likes at any moment. Of this
we have a remarkable instance in the case of Amairgen, seer and judge
of the Milesians or Sons of M&iacute;l, in the story of their conquest
of Ireland, as told in the <i>Book of Leinster</i>, fo. 12<sup>b</sup>.
As he first sets his right foot on the land of Erin he sings a lay in
which he says, that he is a boar, a bull, and a salmon, together with
other things also, such as the sea-breeze, the rolling wave, the roar
of the billows, and a lake on the plain. Nor does he forget to pretend
to wisdom and science beyond other men, and to hint that he is the
divinity that gives them knowledge and sense. The similarity between
this passage and others in the <i>Book of Taliessin</i> has attracted
the attention of scholars: see M. d&rsquo;Arbois de Jubainville&rsquo;s
<i lang="fr">Cycle mythologique irlandais</i>, pp. 242 et seq. On the
whole, Taliessin revels most in the side of the picture devoted to his
knowledge and science: he has passed through so many scenes and changes
that he has been an eye-witness to all kinds of events in Celtic story.
Thus he was with Br&acirc;n on his expedition to Ireland, and saw when
Mor&#273;wyt Ty&#7931;ion was slain in the great slaughter of the
Meal-bag Pavilion. This, however, was not all; he represents himself as
also a <i>sywedy&#273;</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e21114src" href=
"#xd26e21114" name="xd26e21114src">15</a>, &lsquo;<i>vates</i> or
prophet, astrologer <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb617" href=
"#v2pb617" name="v2pb617">617</a>]</span>and astronomer,&rsquo; a sage
who boasts his knowledge of the physical world and propounds questions
which he challenges his rivals to answer concerning earth and sea, day
and night, sun and moon. He is not only Taliessin, but also Gwion, and
hence one infers his magical powers to have been derived. If he regards
anybody as his equal or superior, that seems to have been Talhaiarn, to
whom he ascribes the greatest science. Talhaiarn is usually thought of
only as a great bard by Welsh writers, but it is his science and wisdom
that Taliessin admires<a class="noteref" id="xd26e21249src" href=
"#xd26e21249" name="xd26e21249src">16</a>, whereby one is to
understand, doubtless, that Talhaiarn, like Taliessin, was a great
magician. To this day Welsh bards and bardism have not been quite
dissociated from magic, in so far as the witch Ceridwen is regarded as
their patroness.</p>
<p>The boasts of Amairgen are characterized by M. d&rsquo;Arbois de
Jubainville as a sort of pantheism, and he detects traces of the same
doctrine, among other places, in the teaching of the Irishman, known as
Scotus Erigena, at the court of Charles the Bald in the ninth century:
see the <i lang="fr">Cycle mythologique</i>, p. 248. In any case, one
is prepared by such utterances as those of Amairgen to understand the
charge recorded in the <i>Senchus M&oacute;r</i>, i. 23, as made
against the Irish druids or magicians of his time by a certain Connla
Cainbhrethach, one of the remarkable judges of Erin, conjectured by
O&rsquo;Curry&mdash;on what grounds I do not know&mdash;to have lived
in the first century of our era. The statement there made is to the
following effect:&mdash;&lsquo;After her came Connla Cainbhrethach,
chief doctor of Connaught; he excelled the men of Erin in wisdom, for
he was filled <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb618" href="#v2pb618"
name="v2pb618">618</a>]</span>with the grace of the Holy Ghost; he used
to contend with the druids, who said that it was they that made heaven
and earth, and the sea, &amp;c., and the sun and moon, &amp;c.&rsquo;
This view of the pretensions of the druids is corroborated by the fact
that magic, especially the power of shape-shifting at will, was
regarded as power <i>par excellence</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e21270src" href="#xd26e21270" name="xd26e21270src">17</a>, and by
the old formula of wishing one well, which ran thus: <i>Bendacht dee
ocus andee fort</i>, &lsquo;the blessing of gods and not-gods upon
thee!&rsquo; The term &lsquo;gods&rsquo; in this context is explained
to have meant persons of power<a class="noteref" id="xd26e21289src"
href="#xd26e21289" name="xd26e21289src">18</a>, and the term
&lsquo;not-gods&rsquo; farmers or those connected with the land,
probably all those whose lives were directly dependent on farming and
the cultivation of the soil, as distinguished from professional men
such as druids and smiths. This may be further illustrated by a passage
from the account of the second battle of Moytura, published by Stokes
with a translation, in the <i lang="fr">Revue Celtique</i>, xii.
52&ndash;130. See more especially pp. 74&ndash;6, where we find Lug
offering his services to the king, Nuada of the Silver Hand. Among
other qualifications which Lug possessed, he named that of being a
sorcerer, to which the porter at once replied: &lsquo;We need thee not;
we have sorcerers already. Many are our wizards and our folk of
might&rsquo;&mdash;that is, those of our <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb619" href="#v2pb619" name="v2pb619">619</a>]</span>people who
possess power&mdash;<i>ar lucht cumachtai</i>. Wizards (<i>druith</i>)
and <i>lucht cumachtai</i> came, it is observed, alike under the more
general designation of sorcerers (<i>corrguinigh</i>).</p>
<p>One seems to come upon traces of the same classification of a
community into professionals and non-professionals, for that is what it
comes to, in an obscure Welsh term, <i>Teulu Oeth ac Anoeth</i>, which
may be conjectured to have meant &lsquo;the Household of <i>Oeth</i>
and <i>Anoeth</i>&rsquo; in the sense of Power and Not-power<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e21359src" href="#xd26e21359" name=
"xd26e21359src">19</a>. However <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb620"
href="#v2pb620" name="v2pb620">620</a>]</span>that may be, the
professional class of men who were treated as persons of power and gods
seem to have attained to their position by virtue of the magic of which
they claimed to be masters, and especially of their supposed faculty of
shape-shifting at will. In other words, the druidic pantheism<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e21536src" href="#xd26e21536" name=
"xd26e21536src">20</a> which Erigena was able to dress in the garb of a
fairly respectable philosophy proves to have been, in point of genesis,
but a few removes from a primitive kind of savage folklore.</p>
<p>None of these stories of shape-shifting, and of being born again,
make any allusion to a soul. To revert, for instance, to &#7930;ew
&#7930;awgyffes, it is evident that the eagle cannot be regarded as his
soul. The decayed state of the eagle&rsquo;s body seems to imply that
it was somehow the same body as that of &#7930;ew at the time when he
was wounded by Gronw&rsquo;s poisoned spear: the festering of the
eagle&rsquo;s flesh looks as if considered a continuation of the wound.
It is above all things, however, to be noted that none of the stories
in point, whether Irish or Welsh, contain any suggestion of the
hero&rsquo;s life coming to an end, or in any way perishing; &#7930;ew
lives on to be transformed, under the stroke of Gwydion&rsquo;s wand,
from being an eagle to be a man again; and Tuan mac <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb621" href="#v2pb621" name=
"v2pb621">621</a>]</span>Cairill persists in various forms till he
meets St. Finnen in the sixth century. Then in the case of
&Eacute;t&aacute;in, we are told in the <i>Book of the Dun Cow</i>, fo.
129<sup>a</sup>, that her first-mentioned birth and the next one were
separated by more than a thousand years. So practically we may say that
these stories implied that men and women were imperishable, that they
had no end necessarily to their existence. This sort of notion may be
detected in &#7930;ew&rsquo;s words when he says, &lsquo;Unless God
kill me &hellip; it is not easy to kill me.&rsquo; The reference to the
Almighty may probably be regarded as a comparatively late interpolation
due to Christian teaching. A similar instance seems to occur in a poem
in the <i>Black Book of Carmarthen</i>, fos.
47<sup>b</sup>&ndash;8<sup>b</sup>, where Arthur loudly sings the
praises of his friend Cai. The couplet in point runs thus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>Ny&#775; bei duv ae digonhei.</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>Oet diheit aghev kei.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Unless it were God that wrought it,</p>
<p class="line">Hard to effect were the death of Cai.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">I am not sure, however, of the meaning; for, among
other things, <i>diheit</i>, which I am inclined to interpret as
&lsquo;hard to reach&rsquo; or &lsquo;not easy to effect,&rsquo; has
been rendered otherwise by others<a class="noteref" id="xd26e21580src"
href="#xd26e21580" name="xd26e21580src">21</a>. In any case, the other
instance seems to imply that at one time the heroes of
&#7930;ew&rsquo;s world were not necessarily expected to die at all;
and when they happened to do so, it was probably regarded, as among
savages at the present day, as a result brought about by magic. Any
reader who may feel astonished at such a crudeness of belief, will find
something to contrast and compare in the familiar doctrine, that but
for the fall of Adam and Eve we should have never heard of death,
whether of man or of beast. But if he proceeds to ask questions about
the economy of our world in case nobody died, he must be satisfied to
be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb622" href="#v2pb622" name=
"v2pb622">622</a>]</span>told that to ask any such question is here not
only useless but also irrelevant.</p>
<p>Now, suppose that in a society permeated by the crude kind of
notions of which one finds traces in the <i>Mabinogion</i> and other
old Welsh literature, a man arose who had a turn for philosophizing and
trying to think things out: how would he reason? It seems probable that
he would argue, that underneath all the change there must be some
substratum which is permanent. If Tuan, he would say, changed from one
form to another and remembered all that he had gone through, there must
have been something which lasted, otherwise Tuan would have come to an
end early in the story, and the later individual would not be Tuan at
all. Probably one thing which, according to our folklore
philosopher&rsquo;s way of thinking, lasted through the
transformations, was the material of Tuan&rsquo;s body, just as one is
induced to suppose that &#7930;ew&rsquo;s body, and that of the eagle
into which he was transformed, were considered to be one and the same
body labouring under the mortifying influence of the wound inflicted on
&#7930;ew by Gronw&rsquo;s enchanted spear. Further, we have already
found reasons to regard the existence of the soul as forming a part of
the creed of some at any rate of the early inhabitants of this country,
though we have no means of gathering what precise attributes our
philosopher might ascribe to it besides the single one, perhaps, of
continuing to exist. In that case he might otherwise describe
Tuan&rsquo;s shape-shifting as the entrance of Tuan&rsquo;s soul into a
series of different bodies. Now the philosopher here sketched agrees
pretty closely with the little that is known of the Gaulish druid, such
as he is described by ancient authors<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e21596src" href="#xd26e21596" name="xd26e21596src">22</a>. The
latter seem to have been <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb623" href=
"#v2pb623" name="v2pb623">623</a>]</span>agreed in regarding him as
believing in the immortality of the soul, and several of them appear to
have thought his views similar to those of Pythagoras and his school.
So we may perhaps venture to suppose that the druids, like Pythagoras,
believed in the transmigration of souls, including that from the human
to an animal form and the reverse. If, in the absence of an explicit
statement, one may ascribe this latter form of that belief to the
druids, the identity of their creed becomes almost complete with that
of our conjectured folklore philosopher. At one time I was inclined to
fancy that the druids of Gaul had received no unimportant part of their
teaching from Greek philosophy by way of Massilia, but I am now more
disposed to believe their doctrines to have been gradually developed,
in the way above suggested, from the unfailing resources of that
folklore which revelled in scenes of shape-shifting and rebirth.
Possibly the doctrines of Pythagoras may have themselves had a like
origin and a somewhat parallel development, or let us say rather that
the Orphic notions had, which preceded Pythagoreanism.</p>
<p>But as to Gaul generally, it is not to be assumed that the Gaulish
druids and all the other Gauls held the same opinion on these
questions: we have some evidence that they did <i>not</i>. Thus the
Gauls in the neighbourhood of Massilia<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e21623src" href="#xd26e21623" name="xd26e21623src">23</a>, who
would accept a creditor&rsquo;s promise to pay up in the next world,
can hardly have contemplated the possibility of any such creditor being
then a bird or a moth. Should it be objected that the transformations,
instanced above as Brythonic and Goidelic, were assumed only in the
case of magicians and other professional or privileged persons, and
that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb624" href="#v2pb624" name=
"v2pb624">624</a>]</span>we are not told what was held to happen in the
case of the rank and file of humanity, it is enough to answer that
neither do we know what the druids of Gaul held to be the fate of the
common people of their communities. No lever can be applied in that
direction to disturb the lines of the parallel.</p>
<p>In previous chapters, pp. 45, 54, 61, 88, 97, 229, instances from
Welsh sources have been given of the fairies concealing their names.
But Wales is not the only Celtic land where we find traces of this
treatment of one&rsquo;s name: it is to be detected also on Irish
ground. Thus, when a herald from an enemy&rsquo;s camp comes to parley
with C&uacute;chulainn and his charioteer, the latter, being first
approached, describes himself as the &lsquo;man of the man down
there,&rsquo; meaning C&uacute;chulainn, to whom he pointed; and when
the herald comes to C&uacute;chulainn himself, he asks him whose man he
is: C&uacute;chulainn describes himself as the &lsquo;man of Conchobar
mac Nessa.&rsquo; The herald then inquires if he has no more definite
designation, and C&uacute;chulainn replies that what he has given will
suffice<a class="noteref" id="xd26e21633src" href="#xd26e21633" name=
"xd26e21633src">24</a>: neither of the men gives his name. Thus Celts
of both groups, Brythons and Goidels, are at one in yielding evidence
to the same sort of cryptic treatment of personal names, at some stage
or other in their past history.</p>
<p>The student of man tells us, as already pointed out, that the reason
for the reluctance to disclose one&rsquo;s name was of the same nature
as that which makes savages, and some men belonging to nations above
the savage state feel anxious that an enemy should not get possession
of anything identified with their persons, such as a lock of
one&rsquo;s hair, a drop of one&rsquo;s blood, or anything closely
connected with one&rsquo;s person, lest it should give the enemy power
over one&rsquo;s person as a whole, especially if such enemy is
suspected of possessing any skill <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb625" href="#v2pb625" name="v2pb625">625</a>]</span>in handling the
terrors of magic. In other words, the anthropologist would say that the
name was regarded as identified with the person; and, having said this,
he has mostly felt satisfied that he has definitively disposed of the
matter. Therein, however, he is possibly wrong; for when he says that
the name was probably treated as a part of the man, that only leads one
to ask the question, What part of the man? At any rate, I can see
nothing very unreasonable in such a question, though I am quite willing
to word it differently, and to ask: Is there any evidence to show with
what part of a man his name was associated?</p>
<p>As regards the Aryan nations, we seem to have a clue to an answer in
the interesting group of Aryan words in point, from which I select the
following:&mdash;Irish <i>ainm</i>, &lsquo;a name,&rsquo; plural
<i>anmann</i>; Old Welsh <i>anu</i>, now <i>enw</i>, also &lsquo;a
name&rsquo;; Old Bulgarian <i>ime<sup>n</sup></i> (for
<i>*i&#815;enmen</i>, <i>*anman</i>); Old Prussian <i>emnes</i>,
<i>emmens</i>, accusative <i>emnan</i>; and Armenian <i>anwan</i> (for
a stem <i>*anman</i>)&mdash;all meaning a name. To these some
scholars<a class="noteref" id="xd26e21688src" href="#xd26e21688" name=
"xd26e21688src">25</a> would add, and it may be rightly, the English
word <i>name</i> itself, the Latin <i>nomen</i>, the Sanskrit
<i>n&#257;man</i>, and the Greek <span class="trans" title=
"ynoma"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&#8020;&nu;&omicron;&mu;&alpha;</span></span>; but, as some
others find a difficulty in thus grouping these words, I abstain from
laying any stress on them. In fact, I have every reason to be satisfied
with the wide extent of the Aryan world covered by the other instances
enumerated as Celtic, Prussian, Bulgarian, and Armenian.</p>
<p>Now, such is the similarity between Welsh <i>enw</i>,
&lsquo;name,&rsquo; and <i>enaid</i>, &lsquo;soul,&rsquo; that I cannot
help referring the two words to one and the same origin, especially
when I see the same or rather greater similarity illustrated
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb626" href="#v2pb626" name=
"v2pb626">626</a>]</span>by the Irish words, <i>ainm</i>,
&lsquo;name,&rsquo; and <i>anim</i>, &lsquo;soul.&rsquo; This
similarity between the Irish words so pervades the declension of them,
that a beginner frequently falls into the error of confounding them in
medieval texts. Take, for instance, the genitive singular, <i>anma</i>,
which may mean either <i>anim&aelig;</i> or <i>nominis</i>; the
nominative plural, <i>anmand</i>, which may be either
<i>anim&aelig;</i> or <i>nomina</i>; and the gen. <i>anmand</i>, either
<i>animarum</i> or <i>nominum</i>, as the dative <i>anmannaib</i> may
likewise be either <i>animabus</i> or <i>nominibus</i>. In fact, one is
at first sight almost tempted to suppose that the partial
differentiation of the Irish forms was only brought about under the
influence of Latin, with its distinct forms of <i>anima</i> and
<i>nomen</i>. That would be pressing the point too far; but the direct
teaching of the Celtic vocables is that they are all to be referred to
the same origin in the Aryan word for &lsquo;breath or
breathing,&rsquo; which is represented by such words as Latin
<i>anima</i>, Welsh <i>anadl</i>, &lsquo;breath,&rsquo; and a Gothic
<i>anan</i>, &lsquo;blow or breathe,&rsquo; whence the compound
preterite <i>uz-on</i>, twice used by Ulfilas in the fifteenth chapter
of St. Mark&rsquo;s Gospel to render <span class="trans" title=
"exepneuse"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&#7952;&xi;&#8051;&pi;&nu;&epsilon;&upsilon;&sigma;&epsilon;</span></span>,
&lsquo;gave up the ghost.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now the lessons which the words here grouped together contain for
the student of man is, that the Celts, and certain other widely
separated Aryans, unless we should rather say the whole of the Aryan
family, were once in the habit of closely associating both the soul and
one&rsquo;s name with the breath of life. The evidence is satisfactory
so far as it goes; but let us go a little more into detail, and see as
exactly as we can to what it commits us. Commencing at the beginning,
we may set out with the axiom that breathing is a physical action, and
that in the temperate zone one&rsquo;s breath is not unfrequently
visible. Then one may say that the men who made the words&mdash;Welsh,
<i>enaid</i> (for an earlier <i>anatio-s</i>), &lsquo;soul&rsquo;;
Irish, <i>anim</i> (from an earlier stem, <i>animon</i>); <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb627" href="#v2pb627" name=
"v2pb627">627</a>]</span>Latin, <i>anima</i>, also <i>animus</i>,
&lsquo;feeling, mind, soul&rsquo;; and Greek, <span class="trans"
title="anemos"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&#7940;&nu;&epsilon;&mu;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span></span>,
&lsquo;air, wind&rsquo;&mdash;must have in some way likened the soul to
one&rsquo;s breath, which perhaps first suggested the idea. At all
events they showed not only that they did not contemplate the soul as a
bone, or any solid portion of a man&rsquo;s frame, or even as a manikin
residing inside it: in fact they had made a great advance in the
direction of the abstract notion of a spirit, in which some of them may
have been helped by another association of ideas, namely, that
indicated by speaking of the dead as shades or shadows,
<i>umbr&aelig;</i>, <span class="trans" title="skiai"><span class=
"Greek" lang="grc">&sigma;&kappa;&iota;&alpha;&#8055;</span></span>.
Similarly, the words in point for &lsquo;name&rsquo; seem to prove that
some of the ancient Aryans must have, in some way, associated
one&rsquo;s name with the breath of life. On the other hand, we find
nothing to show that the name and the soul were directly compared or
associated with one another, while the association of the name with the
breath represents, probably, a process as much earlier as it is cruder,
than likening the soul to the breath and naming it accordingly. This is
countenanced to some extent by the general physiognomy, so to say, of
words like <i>enaid</i>, <i>anima</i>, as contrasted with <i>enw</i>,
<i>ainm</i>, <i>nomen</i>, <i>name</i>. Speaking relatively, the former
might be of almost any date in point of comparative lateness, while the
latter could not, belonging as they do to a small declension which was
not wont to receive accessions to its numbers.</p>
<p>In what way, then, or in what respect did early folklore identify
the name with the breath? Before one could expect to answer this
question in anything like a convincing fashion, one would have to
examine the collector of the folklore of savages, or rather to induce
him to cross-examine them on the point. For instance, among the
Singhalese<a class="noteref" id="xd26e21868src" href="#xd26e21868"
name="xd26e21868src">26</a>, when in the ceremony of name-giving the
father utters the baby&rsquo;s name in a low <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb628" href="#v2pb628" name=
"v2pb628">628</a>]</span>whisper in the baby&rsquo;s ear, is that
called breathing the name? and is the name so whispered called a breath
or a breathing? In the case of the savages who name their children at
their birth, is the reason ever advanced that a name must be given to
the child in order to make it breathe, or, at least, in order to
facilitate its breathing? Some such a notion of reinforcing the
child&rsquo;s vitality and safety would harmonize well enough with the
fact that, as Mr. Clodd<a class="noteref" id="xd26e21876src" href=
"#xd26e21876" name="xd26e21876src">27</a> puts it, &lsquo;Barbaric,
Pagan, and Christian folklore is full of examples of the importance of
naming and other birth-ceremonies, in the belief that the child&rsquo;s
life is at the mercy of evil spirits watching the chance of casting
spells upon it, of demons covetous to possess it, and of fairies eager
to steal it and leave a &ldquo;changeling&rdquo; in its place.&rsquo;
Provisionally, one must perhaps rest content to suppose the association
of the name to have taken place with the breath regarded as an
accompaniment of life. Looked at in that sense, the name becomes
associated with one&rsquo;s life, and, speaking roughly, with
one&rsquo;s person; and it is interesting to notice that one seems to
detect traces in Welsh literature of some confusion of the kind. Thus,
when the hero of the story of Kulhwch and Olwen was christened he was
named Kulhwch, which is expressed in Welsh as &lsquo;forcing or driving
Kulhwch on him&rsquo; (<i lang="cy">gyrru kulh&#7933;ch
arna&#7933;</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e21884src" href="#xd26e21884"
name="xd26e21884src">28</a>); <i>Kulh&#7933;ch</i>, be it noticed, not
the name Kulhwch. Similarly when Br&acirc;n, on the eve of his
expedition to Ireland, left seven princes, or knights as they are also
called, to take charge of his dominions, we have an instance of the
kind. The stead or town was named after the seven knights, and it is a
place which is now known as <i>Bryn y Saith Marchog</i>, &lsquo;the
Hill of the Seven Knights,&rsquo; near Gwy&#273;elwern, in
Merionethshire. But the wording of the <i>Mabinogi</i> of Branwen is
<i lang="cy">o acha&#7933;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb629"
href="#v2pb629" name="v2pb629">629</a>]</span>hynny y dodet seith
marcha&#7933;c ar y dref</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e21904src" href=
"#xd26e21904" name="xd26e21904src">29</a>, meaning &lsquo;for that
reason the stead was called Seven Knights,&rsquo; literally &lsquo;for
that reason one put Seven Knights on the stead.&rsquo; In Guest&rsquo;s
<i>Mabinogion</i>, iii. 116, this will be found rendered wrongly,
though not wholly without excuse&mdash;&lsquo;for this reason were the
seven knights placed in the town.&rsquo; It is probable that the
redactor of the stories from which the two foregoing instances
come&mdash;and more might be cited&mdash;was not so much courting
ambiguities as adhering to an old form of expression which neglected
from the first to distinguish, in any formal way, between names and the
persons or things which they would, in modern phraseology, be said to
represent<a class="noteref" id="xd26e21913src" href="#xd26e21913" name=
"xd26e21913src">30</a>.</p>
<p>An instance has been already mentioned of a man&rsquo;s name being
put or set on him, or rather forced on him: at any rate, his name is
<i>on</i> him both in Welsh and Irish, and the latter language also
speaks of it as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb630" href="#v2pb630"
name="v2pb630">630</a>]</span>cleaving or adhering to him. Neither
language contemplates the name, however closely identified with him, as
having become an inseparable part of him, or else as something he has
secured for himself. In the neo-Celtic tongues, both Welsh and Irish,
all things which a man owns, and all things for which he takes credit,
are <i>with</i> him or <i>by</i> him; but all things which he cannot
help having, whether creditable or discreditable, if they are regarded
as coming from without are <i>on</i> him, not <i>with</i> him. Thus, if
he is wealthy there is money with him; but if he is in debt and owes
money, the money is on him. Similarly, if he rejoices there is joy with
him; whereas if he is ashamed or afraid, shame or fear is on him. This
is a far-reaching distinction, of capital importance in Celtic
phraseology, and judged by this criterion the name is something from
without the man, something which he cannot take credit to himself for
having acquired by his own direct willing or doing. This is to be borne
in mind when one speaks of the name as identified or closely bound up
with one&rsquo;s life and personality. But this qualified
identification of the name with the man is also what one may infer from
savage folklore; for many, perhaps most, of the nations who name their
children at their birth, have those names changed when the children
grow up. That is done when a boy has to be initiated into the mysteries
of his tribe or of a guild, or it may be when he has achieved some
distinction in war. In most instances, it involves a serious ceremony
and the intervention of the wise man, whether the medicine-man of a
savage system, or the priest of a higher religion<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e22020src" href="#xd26e22020" name="xd26e22020src">31</a>. In the
ancient Wales of the <i>Mabinogion</i>, and in pagan Ireland,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb631" href="#v2pb631" name=
"v2pb631">631</a>]</span>the name-giving was done, subject to certain
conditions, at the will and on the initiative of the druid, who was at
the same time tutor and teacher of the youth to be renamed<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e22031src" href="#xd26e22031" name=
"xd26e22031src">32</a>. Here I may be allowed to direct attention to
the two following facts: the druid, recalling as he does the magician
of the Egypt of the Pentateuch and the shaman of the Mongolian world of
our own time, represented a profession probably not of Celtic origin.
In the next place, his method of selecting names from incidents was
palpably incompatible with what is known to have been the Aryan system
of nomenclature, by means of compounds, as evinced by the annals of
most nations of the Aryan family of speech: such compounds, I mean, as
Welsh <i>Pen-wyn</i>, &lsquo;white-headed,&rsquo; Gaulish <span class=
"trans" title="Penno-ouindos"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&Pi;&epsilon;&nu;&nu;&omicron;-&omicron;&upsilon;&iota;&nu;&delta;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span></span>,
or Greek <span class="trans" title="Hipparchos"><span class="Greek"
lang=
"grc">&#7997;&pi;&pi;&alpha;&rho;&chi;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span></span>,
<span class="trans" title="Archippos"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&#7948;&rho;&chi;&iota;&pi;&pi;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span></span>,
and the like. Briefly, one may say that the association of the name
with the breath of life was probably Aryan, but without, perhaps, being
unfamiliar to the aborigines of the British Isles before their conquest
by the Celts. On the other hand, in the druid and his method of naming
we seem to touch the non-Aryan substratum, and to detect something
which was not Celtic, not Aryan<a class="noteref" id="xd26e22074src"
href="#xd26e22074" name="xd26e22074src">33</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps the reader will not regard it as wholly irrelevant if here I
change the subject for a while from one&rsquo;s name to other words and
locutions in so far as they may be regarded as illustrative of the
mental surroundings in which the last paragraph leaves the name. I
allude especially to the exaggerated influence associated with a form
of words, more particularly among the Irish Celts. O&rsquo;Curry gives
a tragic <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb632" href="#v2pb632" name=
"v2pb632">632</a>]</span>instance: the poet N&eacute;de mac Adnai, in
order to obtain possession of the throne of Connaught, asked an
impossible request of the king, who was his own father&rsquo;s brother
and named Caier. When the king declared his inability to accede to his
demand the poet made the refusal his excuse for composing on the king
what was called in Irish an <i>&aacute;ir</i> or <i>&aacute;er</i>,
written later <i>aor</i>, &lsquo;satire,&rsquo; which ran approximately
thus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Evil, death, short life to Caier!</p>
<p class="line">May spears of battle wound Caier!</p>
<p class="line">Caier quenched, Caier forced, Caier underground!</p>
<p class="line">Under ramparts, under stones with Caier!</p>
</div>
<p class="first">O&rsquo;Curry goes on to relate how Caier, washing his
face at the fountain next morning, discovered that it had three
blisters on it, which the satire had raised, to wit, disgrace, blemish,
and defect, in colours of crimson, green, and white. So Caier fleeing,
that his plight might not be seen of his friends, came to Dun Cearmna
(now the Old Head of Kinsale, in county Cork), the residence of
Caichear, chief of that district. There Caier was well received as a
stranger of unknown quality, while N&eacute;de assumed the sovereignty
of Connaught. In time, N&eacute;de came to know of Caier being there,
and rode there in Caier&rsquo;s chariot. But as N&eacute;de approached
Caier escaped through his host&rsquo;s house and hid himself in the
cleft of a rock, whither N&eacute;de followed Caier&rsquo;s greyhound;
and when Caier saw N&eacute;de, the former dropped dead of
shame<a class="noteref" id="xd26e22105src" href="#xd26e22105" name=
"xd26e22105src">34</a>. This abstract of the story as told by
O&rsquo;Curry, will serve to show how the words of the satirist were
dreaded by high and low among the ancient Irish, and how their demands
had to be at once obeyed. It is a commonplace of Irish literature that
the satirist&rsquo;s words unfailingly raised blisters on the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb633" href="#v2pb633" name=
"v2pb633">633</a>]</span>face of him at whom they were aimed. A portion
at least of the potency of the poet&rsquo;s words seems to have been
regarded as due to their being given a certain metrical form. That,
however, does not show how the poet had acquired his influence, and one
cannot shut one&rsquo;s eyes to the fact that the means he might adopt
to make his influence felt and his wishes instantly attended to,
implied that the race with which he had to deal was a highly sensitive
one: I may perhaps apply to it the adjective thin-skinned, in the
literal sense of that word. For the blisters on the face are only an
exaggeration of a natural phenomenon. On this point my attention has
been called by a friend to the following passages in a review of a work
on the pathology of the emotions<a class="noteref" id="xd26e22116src"
href="#xd26e22116" name="xd26e22116src">35</a>:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To both the hurtful and curative effects of the emotions M.
F&eacute;r&eacute; devotes much attention, and on these points makes
some interesting remarks. That the emotions act on the body, more by
their effects on the circulation than by anything else, is no new
thesis, but M. F&eacute;r&eacute; is developing some new branches of
it. That the heart may be stopped for a few seconds, and that there may
be localised flush and pallor of the skin, owing to almost any strong
emotion, whether it be joy, anger, fear, or pain, is a matter of common
observation; and that there may be many changes of nutrition due to
vaso-motor disturbance is a point easy to establish. The skin is
particularly easily affected; passion and pain may produce a sweat that
is truly hemorrhagic (Parrot); and the scientific world is obliged to
admit that in the stigmata of Louise Lateau the blood vessels were
really broken, and not broken by anything else <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb634" href="#v2pb634" name=
"v2pb634">634</a>]</span>than an emotional state as cause. In a
shipwreck Follain tells us that the pilot was covered in an hour with
pustules from his fear; and the doctor sees many
<i>dermato-neuroses</i>, such as nettle-rash, herpes, pemphigus,
vitiligo, &amp;c, from the <i lang="fr">choc moral</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I can illustrate this from my own observation: when I was an
undergraduate there was with me at college a Welsh undergraduate, who,
when teased or annoyed by his friends, was well known to be subject to
a sort of rash or minute pustules on his face: it would come on in the
course of an hour or so. There is a well-known Welsh line on this
subject of the face which is to the point:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>Ni chel gru&#273; gystu&#273; c&agrave;lon.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">The cheek hides not the heart&rsquo;s affliction.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">So a man who was insulted, or whose honour was
assailed, might be said to be thereby put to the blush or to be
otherwise injured in his face; and the Irish word <i>enech</i>,
&lsquo;face,&rsquo; is found commonly used as a synonym for one&rsquo;s
honour or good name. The same appears to have been the case with the
Welsh equivalent, <i>wyneb</i>, &lsquo;face,&rsquo; and <i>dyn
di-wyneb</i>, literally &lsquo;a faceless man,&rsquo; appears to be now
used in Carnarvonshire and Glamorgan in the sense of one who is without
a sense of honour, an unprincipled fellow. So when Welsh law dealt with
insults and attacks on one&rsquo;s honour the payment to be made to the
injured person was called <i>gwynebwerth</i>, &lsquo;the price of
one&rsquo;s face,&rsquo; or <i>gwynebwarth</i>, &lsquo;the payment for
disgracing one&rsquo;s face.&rsquo; Irish law arranged for similar
damages, and called them by analogous names, such as <i>enech-gris</i>,
&lsquo;a fine for injuring or raising a blush on the face,&rsquo; and
<i>enech-l&oacute;g</i> or <i>enech-lann</i>, &lsquo;honour
price&rsquo;; compare also <i>enech-ruice</i>, &lsquo;a face-reddening
or blushing caused by some act or scandal which brought shame on a
family.&rsquo; Possibly one has to do with traces of somewhat the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb635" href="#v2pb635" name=
"v2pb635">635</a>]</span>same type of &lsquo;face,&rsquo; though it has
faded away to the verge of vanishing, when one speaks in English of
keeping another in countenance.</p>
<p>It has been suggested that if a magician got a man&rsquo;s name he
could injure him by means of his arts: now the converse seems to have
been the case with the Irish <i>&aacute;er</i> or satire, for to be
effective it had, as in the instance of Caier, to mention the
victim&rsquo;s name; and a curious instance occurs in the <i>Book of
Leinster</i>, fo. 117, where the poet Atherne failed to curse a person
whose name he could not manipulate according to the rules of his
satire. This man Atherne is described as inhospitable, stingy, and
greedy to the last degree. So it is related how he sallied forth one
day, taking with him a cooked pig and a pot of mead, to a place where
he intended to gorge himself without being observed. But no sooner had
he settled down to his meal than he saw a man approaching, who remarked
to him on his operating on the food all alone, and unceremoniously
picked up the porker and the pot of mead. As he was coolly walking away
with them, Atherne cried out after him, &lsquo;What is thy name?&rsquo;
The stranger replied that it was nothing very grand, and gave it as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>Sethor . ethor . othor . sele . dele . dreng
gerce</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>Mec gerlusce . ger ger . d&iacute;r d&iacute;r issed
moainmse.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Sethor-Ethor-Othor-Sele-Dele-Dreng gerce</p>
<p class="line">Son of Gerlusce ger-ger-d&iacute;r-d&iacute;r, that is
my name.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">The story goes on to say that Atherne neither saw his
meal any more nor succeeded in making a satire on the name of the
stranger, who accordingly got away unscathed. It was surmised, we are
told, that he was an angel come from God to teach the poet better
manners. This comic story brings us back to the importance of the name,
as it implies that the cursing poet, had he been able to seize it and
duly work it <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb636" href="#v2pb636"
name="v2pb636">636</a>]</span>into his satire, could not have failed to
bring about the intruder&rsquo;s discomfiture. The magician and
folklore philosopher, far from asking with Juliet, &lsquo;What&rsquo;s
in a name?&rsquo; would have rather put it the other way,
&lsquo;What&rsquo;s not in a name?&rsquo; At any rate the ancients
believed that there was a great deal in a name, and traces of the
importance which they gave it are to be found in modern speech: witness
the article on <i>name</i> or its equivalent in a big dictionary of any
language possessed of a great literature.</p>
<p>It has been seen that it is from the point of view of magic that the
full importance of one&rsquo;s name was most keenly realized by our
ancient Celts; that is, of magic more especially in that stage of its
history when it claimed as its own a certain degree of skill in the art
of verse-making. Perhaps, indeed, it would be more accurate to suppose
that verse-making appertained from the outset to magic, and that it was
magicians, medicine-men, or seers, who, for their own use, first
invented the aids of rhythm and metre. The subject, however, of magic
and its accessories is far too vast to be treated here: it has been
touched upon here and there in some of the previous chapters, and I may
add that wizardry and magic form the machinery, so to say, of the
stories called in Welsh the &lsquo;Four Branches of the
<i>Mabinogi</i>&rsquo; namely those of Pwy&#7931;, Branwen,
Manawy&#273;an, and Math. Now these four, together with the adventure
of &#7930;&ucirc;&#273; and &#7930;evelys, and, in a somewhat qualified
sense, the story of Kulhwch and Olwen, represent in a Brythonicized
form the otherwise lost legends of the Welsh Goidels; and, like those
of the Irish Goidels, they are remarkable for their wizardry. Nor is
that all, for in the former the kings are mostly the greatest magicians
of their time: or shall I rather put it the other way, and say that in
them the greatest magicians function as kings? Witness Math son
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb637" href="#v2pb637" name=
"v2pb637">637</a>]</span>of Mathonwy king of Gwyne&#273;, and his
sister&rsquo;s son, Gwydion ab D&ocirc;n, to whom as his successor he
duly taught his magic; then come the arch-enchanter Arawn, king of
Annwn, and Caswa&#7931;on ab Beli, represented as winning his kingdom
by the sheer force of magic. To these might be added other members of
the kingly families whose story shows them playing the r&ocirc;le of
magicians, such as Rhiannon, who by her magic arts foiled her powerful
suitor, Gwawl ab Cl&ucirc;d, and secured as her consort the man of her
choice, Pwy&#7931; prince of Dyfed. Here also, perhaps, one might
mention Manawy&#273;an ab &#7930;yr, who, as Manann&aacute;n mac Lir,
figures in the stories of the Goidels of Erin and Man as a consummate
wizard and first king of the Manx people: see p. 314 above. In the
<i>Mabinogi</i>, however, no act of magic is ascribed to
Manawy&#273;an, though he is represented successfully checkmating the
most formidable wizard arrayed against him and his friends, to wit,
&#7930;wyd ab Kilcoed. Not only does one get the impression that the
ruling class in these stories of the Welsh Goidels had their magic
handed down from generation to generation according to a fixed rule of
maternal succession (pp. 326, 503, 505), but it supplies the complete
answer to and full explanation of questions as to the meaning of the
terms already mentioned, <i>Tuatha D&eacute; ocus And&eacute;</i>, and
<i>Lucht Cumachtai</i>, together with its antithesis. Within the
magic-wielding class exercising dominion over the shepherds and tillers
of the soil of the country, it is but natural to suppose that the first
king was the first magician or greatest medicine-man, as in the case of
Manann&aacute;n in the Isle of Man. This must of course be understood
to apply to the early history of the Goidelic race, or, perhaps more
correctly speaking, to one of the races which had contributed to its
composition: to the aborigines, let us say, by whatsoever name or names
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb638" href="#v2pb638" name=
"v2pb638">638</a>]</span>you may choose to call them, whether Picts or
Ivernians. It is significant, among other things, that our traditions
should connect the potency of ancient wizardry with descent in the
female line of succession, and, in any case, one cannot be wrong in
assuming magic to have begun very low down in the scale of social
progress, probably lower than religion, with which it is essentially in
antagonism. As the crude and infantile pack of notions, collectively
termed sympathetic magic&mdash;beginning with the belief that any
effect may be produced by imitating the action of the cause of it, or
even doing anything that would recall it<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e22227src" href="#xd26e22227" name=
"xd26e22227src">36</a>&mdash;grew into the panoply of the magician, he
came to regard himself, and to be regarded by others, as able for his
own benefit and that of his friends to coerce all possible opponents,
whether men or demons, heroes or gods. This left no room for the
attitude of prayer and worship: religion in that sense could only come
later. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb639" href="#v2pb639" name=

<i>Sywedy&#273;</i> is probably a word of Goidelic origin: compare
Irish <i>s&uacute;i</i>, &lsquo;a sage,&rsquo; genitive
<i>s&uacute;ad</i>, and derivative <i>s&uacute;ithe</i>,
&lsquo;wisdom.&rsquo; Stokes suggests the derivation <i>su-vet</i>, in
which case <i>s&uacute;i</i> = <i>su-vi</i>, for <i>su-viss</i> =
<i>su-vet-s</i>, and <i>s&uacute;-ithe</i> = <i>suveti&#815;a</i>,
while the Welsh <i>sywedy&#273;</i> is formally <i>su-veti&#815;os</i>
or <i>su-vetii&#815;os</i>. Welsh has also <i>syw</i>, from
<i>s&uacute;i</i>, like <i>dryw</i>, &lsquo;a druid,&rsquo; from
Goidelic <i>dr&uacute;i</i>. <i>Syw</i>, it is true, now only means
elegant, tidy; but Dr. Davies of Ma&#7931;wyd believed its original
signification to have been &lsquo;<i lang="la">sapiens, doctus,
peritus</i>.&rsquo; The root <i>vet</i> is most probably to be
identified with the <i>wet</i> of Med. Welsh <i>gwet-id</i>, &lsquo;a
saying,&rsquo; <i>dy-wawt</i>, &lsquo;<i>dixit</i>,&rsquo; whence it
appears that the bases were <i>v&#277;t</i> and <i>v&#257;t</i>, with
the latter of which Irish <i>f&aacute;ith</i>, &lsquo;a poet or
prophet,&rsquo; Latin <i>v&#257;tes</i>, agrees, as also the Welsh
<i>gwawd</i>, &lsquo;poetry, sarcasm,&rsquo; and in Mod. Welsh,
&lsquo;any kind of derision.&rsquo; In the <i>Book of Taliessin</i>
<i>syw</i> has, besides the plurals <i>sywyon</i> and <i>sywydon</i>
(Skene, ii. 142, 152), possibly an older plural, <i>sywet</i> (p. 155)
= <i>su-vet-es</i>, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb617n" href=
"#v2pb617n" name="v2pb617n">617</a>]</span>while for
<i>s&uacute;ithe</i> = <i>su-veti&#815;a</i> we seem to have
<i>sywyd</i> or <i>sewyd</i> (pp. 142, 152, 193); but all the passages
in point are more or less obscure, I must confess.&nbsp;<a class=

as follows:&mdash;&lsquo;Of these are the <i>Tuatha Dee</i> and

think it probable, judging from the intelligence of the <i>Tuatha</i>
and their superiority in knowledge, that they belong to the exiles who

Evans&rsquo; <i>Black Book of Carmarthen</i>, fo. 33<sup>b</sup>; also
the <i>Mabinogion</i>, pp. 104, 306. The Irish <i>lucht cumachtai</i>
would be in Welsh literally rendered <i>&#7931;wyth cyfoeth</i>,
&lsquo;the <i>cyfoeth</i> tribe or host,&rsquo; as it were. For
<i>cyfoeth</i>, in Med. Welsh, meant power or dominion, whence
<i>cyfoethog</i>, &lsquo;powerful,&rsquo; and
<i>ho&#7931;-gyfoethog</i>, &lsquo;almighty&rsquo;; but in Mod. Welsh
<i>cyfoeth</i> and <i>cyfoethog</i> have been degraded to mean
&lsquo;riches&rsquo; and &lsquo;rich&rsquo; respectively. Now if we
dropped the prefix <i>cum</i> from the Irish <i>cumachtai</i>, and its
equivalent <i>cyf</i> from the Welsh <i>cyfoeth</i>, we should have
<i>lucht cumachtai</i> reduced to an approximate analogy to
<i><span class="corr" id="xd26e21412" title=
"Source: llwyth">&#7931;wyth</span></i> <i>Oeth</i>, &lsquo;the
<span class="corr" id="xd26e21419" title=
"Source: Oeth"><i>Oeth</i></span> tribe,&rsquo; for which we have the
attested equivalent <i>Teulu Oeth</i>, &lsquo;the <i>Oeth</i> household
or family.&rsquo; <i>Oeth</i>, however, seems to have meant powerful
rather than power, and this seems to have been its force in
Gwalchmai&rsquo;s poetry of the twelfth century, where I find it twice:
see the <i>Myvyrian Arch.</i>, i. 196<sup>b</sup>, 203<sup>a</sup>. In
the former passage we have <i>oeth dybydaf o dybwyf ryd</i>, &lsquo;I
shall be powerful if I be free,&rsquo; and in the latter <i>oeth ym
uthrwyd</i>, &lsquo;mightily was I astonished or dismayed.&rsquo;
<i>An-oeth</i> was the negative of <i>oeth</i>, and meant weak, feeble,
frivolous: so we find its plural, <i>anoetheu</i>, applied in the story
of Kulhwch to the strange quests on which Kulhwch had to engage himself
and his friends, before he could hope to obtain Olwen to be his wife.
This has its parallel in the use of the adjective <i>gwan</i>,
&lsquo;weak,&rsquo; in the following instance among them:&mdash;Arthur
and his men were ready to set out in search of Mabon son of Modron, who
was said to have been kidnapped, when only three nights old, from
between his mother Modron and the wall; and though this had happened a
fabulously long time before Arthur was born, nothing had ever been
since heard of Mabon&rsquo;s fate. Now Arthur&rsquo;s men said that
they would set out in search of him, but they considered that Arthur
should not accompany them on feeble quests of the kind: their words
were (p. 128), <i lang="cy">ny e&#7931;i di uynet ath lu y
geissa&#7933; peth mor</i> uan <i lang="cy">ar rei hynn</i>,
&lsquo;thou canst not go with thy army to seek a thing so <i>weak</i>
as these are.&rsquo; Here we have <i>uan</i> as the synonym of
<i>an-oeth</i>; but <i>Oeth ac Anoeth</i> probably became a phrase
which was seldom analysed or understood; so we have besides <i>Teulu
Oeth ac Anoeth</i>, a <i>Caer Oeth ac Anoeth</i>, or fortress of O. and
A., and a <i>Carchar Caer Oeth ac Anoeth</i>, or the Prison of Caer O.
and A., which is more shortly designated also <i>Carchar Oeth ac
Anoeth</i>, or the Prison of O. and A. A late account of the building
of that strange prison and fortress by Manawy&#273;an is given in the
<i>Iolo MSS.</i>, pp. 185&ndash;6, 263, and it is needless to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb620n" href="#v2pb620n" name=
"v2pb620n">620</a>]</span>point out that Manawy&#273;an, son of
&#7930;yr, was no other than the Manann&aacute;n mac Lir of Irish
literature, the greatest wizard among the Tuatha D&eacute; or Tuatha
D&eacute; Danann; for the practical equivalence of those names is
proved by the <i>Book of the Dun Cow</i>, fo. 16<sup>b</sup>. For
further details about <i>Oeth</i> and <i>Anoeth</i>, Silvan
Evans&rsquo; <i>Geiriadur</i> may be consulted, s. v. <i>Anoeth</i>,
where instances are cited of the application of those terms to tilled
land and wild or uncultivated land. Here the words seem to have the
secondary meanings of profitable and unprofitable lands, respectively:
compare a somewhat analogous use of <i>grym</i>, &lsquo;strength,
force,&rsquo; in a passage relating to the mutilated horses of
Matholwch&mdash;<i>hyt nad oed</i> rym <i>a e&#7931;it ar meirch</i>,
&lsquo;so that no use was possible in the case of the horses,&rsquo;
meaning that they were of no use whatever, or that they had been done
for: see the Oxford <i>Mabinogion</i>, p. 29, and Lady Charlotte

to Irish, I would not lay much stress on the question &lsquo;What is
your name?&rsquo; being put, in a fourteenth or fifteenth century
version of the French story of Fierabras, as <i lang="cy">ca hainm
t&uacute;</i>?&mdash;literally, &lsquo;what name art thou?&rsquo; see
the <i lang="fr">Revue Celtique</i>, xix. 28. It may be mentioned here
that the Irish writers of glossaries had a remarkable way of appearing
to identify words and things. Thus, for instance, Cormac has
<i>Cruimther .i. G&aelig;delg indi as presbyter</i>, which
O&rsquo;Donovan (edited by Stokes) has translated, p. 30, as
&lsquo;<i>Cruimther</i>, i. e. the Gaelic of <i lang=
"la">presbyter</i>&rsquo;: literally it would be rather &lsquo;of the
thing which is presbyter.&rsquo; Similarly, Cormac&rsquo;s explanation
of the Irish <i>aiminn</i>, now <i>aoibhinn</i>,
&lsquo;delightful,&rsquo; runs thus in Latin, <i lang="la">Aimind ab eo
quod est amoenum</i>, &lsquo;from the word <i>amoenus</i>,&rsquo;
literally, &lsquo;from that which is <i>amoenus</i>.&rsquo; But this
construction is a favourite one of Latin grammarians, and instances
will be found in Professor Lindsay&rsquo;s <i>Latin Language</i>
(Oxford, 1894), pp. 26, 28, 42, 53. On calling his attention to it, he
kindly informed me that it can be traced as far back as Varro, from
whose <i>Lingua Latina</i>, vi. 4, he cites <i>Meridies ab eo quod
medius dies</i>. So in this matter, Irish writers have merely imitated
their Latin models; and one detects a trace of the same imitation in
some of the Old Welsh glosses, for instance in the <i lang=
"la">Juvencus Codex</i>, where we have <span class=
"xd26e21962">XPS</span> explained as <i lang="ga">irhinn issid
crist</i>, &lsquo;that which is Christ,&rsquo; evidently meaning,
&lsquo;the word <span class="trans" title="Christos"><span class=

&lsquo;a state or country,&rsquo; in <i lang="la">celsi thronus est cui

&lsquo;that is the word <i>gulat</i> for him&rsquo; = &lsquo;he means

<div class="epigraph">
<p class="first">The method of philological mythology is thus
discredited by the disputes of its adherents. The system may be called
orthodox, but it is an orthodoxy which alters with every new scholar
who enters the sacred enclosure.&mdash;<span class="sc">Andrew
Lang.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It has been well said, that while it is not science to
know the contents of myths, it is science to know why the human race
has produced them. It is not my intention to trace minutely the history
of that science, but I may hazard the remark, that she could not be
said to have reached years of discretion till she began to compare one
thing with another; and even when mythology had become comparative
mythology, her horizon remained till within recent years comparatively
narrow. In other words, the comparisons were wont to be very
circumscribed: you might, one was told, compare the myths of Greeks and
Teutons and Hindus, because those nations were considered to be of the
same stock; but even within that range comparisons were scarcely
contemplated, except in the case of myths enshrined in the most
classical literatures of those nations. This kind of mythology was
eclectic rather than comparative, and it was apt to regard myths as a
mere disease of language. By-and-by, however, the student showed a
preference for a larger field and a wider range; and in so doing he
was, whether <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb640" href="#v2pb640"
name="v2pb640">640</a>]</span>consciously or unconsciously, beginning
to keep step with a larger movement extending to the march of all the
kindred sciences, and especially that of language.</p>
<p>At one time the student of language was satisfied with mummified
speech, wrapped up, as it were, in the musty coils of the records of
the past: in fact, he often became a mere researcher of the dead letter
of language, instead of a careful observer of the breath of life
animating her frame. So long as that remained the case, glottology
deserved the whole irony of Voltaire&rsquo;s well-known account of
etymology as being in fact, &lsquo;une science o&ugrave; les voyelles
ne font rien, et les consonnes fort peu de chose.&rsquo; In the course,
however, of recent years a great change has come over the scene: not
only have the laws of the Aryan consonants gained greatly in precision,
but those of the Aryan vowels have at last been discovered to a
considerable extent. The result for me and others who learnt that the
Aryan peasant of idyllic habits harped eternally on the three notes of
<i>a</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>u</i>, is that we have to unlearn this and a
great deal more: in fact, the vowels prove to be far more troublesome
than the consonants. But difficult as these lessons are, the
glottologist must learn them, unless he is content to remain with the
stragglers who happen to be unable to move on. Now the change to which
I allude, in connexion with the study of language, has been inseparably
accompanied with the paying of increased attention to actual speech,
with a more careful scrutiny of dialects, even obscure dialects such as
the literary man is wont to regard with scorn.</p>
<p>Similarly the student of mythology now seeks the wherewithal of his
comparisons from the mouth of the traveller and the missionary,
wherever they may roam; not from the <i>Rig-Veda</i> or the
<i>Iliad</i> alone, but from the rude stories of the peasant, and the
wild fancies of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb641" href="#v2pb641"
name="v2pb641">641</a>]</span>the savage from Tierra del Fuego to
Greenland&rsquo;s icy mountains. The parallel may be drawn still
closer. Just as the glottologist, fearing lest the written letter may
have slurred over or hidden away important peculiarities of ancient
speech, resorts for a corrective to the actuality of modern Aryan, so
the mythologist, apt to suspect the testimony of the highly respectable
bards of the <i>Rig-Veda</i>, may on occasion give ear to the fresh
evidence of a savage, however inconsequent it may sound. The movements
to which I allude in glottology and mythology began so recently that
their history has not yet been written. Suffice it to say that in
glottology, or the science of language, the names most intimately
connected with the new departure are those of Ascoli, J. Schmidt, and
Fick, those of Leskien, Brugmann, Osthoff, and De Saussure; while of
the names of the teachers of the anthropological method of studying
myths, several are by this time household words in this country. But,
so far as I know, the first to give a systematic exposition of the
subject was Professor Tylor, in his work on <i>Primitive Culture</i>,
published first in 1871.</p>
<p>Such has been the intimate connexion between mythology and
glottology that I may be pardoned for going back again to the latter.
It is applicable in its method to all languages, but, as a matter of
fact, it came into being in the domain of Aryan philology, so that it
has been all along principally the science of comparing the Aryan
languages with one another. It began with Sir William Jones&rsquo;
discovery of the kinship of Sanskrit with Greek and Latin, and for a
long time it took the lead of the more closely related sciences: this
proved partly beneficial and partly the reverse. In the case of
ethnology, for instance, the influence of glottology has probably done
more harm than good, since it has opened up a wide field for
confounding race with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb642" href=
"#v2pb642" name="v2pb642">642</a>]</span>language. In the case of
mythology the same influence has been partly helpful, and it has partly
fallen short of being such. Where names could be analysed with
certainty, and where they could be equated, leaving little room for
doubt, as in the case of that of the Greek <span class="trans" title=
"Zeus"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&Zeta;&epsilon;&#8059;&sigmaf;</span></span>, the Norse
<i>T&yacute;r</i>, and the Sanskrit <i>Dyaus</i>, the science of
language rendered a veritable help to mythology; but where the students
of language, all pointing in different directions, claimed each to hold
in his hand the one safety-lamp, beyond the range of which the
mythologist durst not take a single step except at the imminent risk of
breaking his neck, the help may be pronounced, to say the least of it,
as somewhat doubtful. The anthropological method of studying myths put
an end to the unequal relation between the students of the two
sciences, and it is now pretty well agreed that the proper relationship
between them is that of mutual aid. This will doubtless prove the
solution of the whole matter, but it would be premature to say that the
period of strained relations is quite over, since the mythologist has
so recently made good his escape from the embarrassing attentions of
the students of language, that he has not yet quite got out of his ears
the bewildering notes of the chorus of discordant cries of
&lsquo;Dawn,&rsquo; &lsquo;Sun,&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Storm-cloud.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now that I have touched on the friendly relations which ought to
exist between the science of language and the science of myth, I may
perhaps be allowed to notice a point or two where it is possible or
desirable for the one to render service to the other. The student of
language naturally wants the help of the student of myth, ritual, and
religion on matters which most immediately concern his own department
of study; and I may perhaps be excused for taking my stand on Celtic
ground, and calling attention to some of my own <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb643" href="#v2pb643" name=
"v2pb643">643</a>]</span>difficulties. Here is one of them: when one
would say in English &lsquo;It rains&rsquo; or &lsquo;It
freezes,&rsquo; I should have to say in my own language, <i>Y mae
hi&rsquo;n bwrw glaw</i> and <i>Y mae hi&rsquo;n rhewi</i>, which
literally means &lsquo;She is casting rain&rsquo; and &lsquo;She is
freezing.&rsquo; Nor is this sort of locution confined to weather
topics, for when you would say &lsquo;He is badly off&rsquo; or
&lsquo;He is hard up,&rsquo; a Welshman might say, <i>Y mae hi&rsquo;n
&#273;rwg arno</i> or <i>Y mae hi&rsquo;n galed arno</i>, that is
literally, &lsquo;She is evil on him&rsquo; or &lsquo;She is hard on
him.&rsquo; And the same feminine pronoun fixes itself in other
locutions in the language. Now I wish to invoke the student of myth,
ritual, and religion to help in the identification of this ubiquitous
&lsquo;she&rsquo; of the Welsh. Whenever it is mentioned to Englishmen,
it merely calls to their minds the Highland &lsquo;she&rsquo; of
English and Scotch caricature, as for instance when Sir Walter Scott
makes Donald appeal in the following strain to Lord Menteith&rsquo;s
man, Anderson, who had learnt manners in France: &lsquo;What the deil,
man, can she no drink after her ain master without washing the cup and
spilling the ale, and be tamned to her!&rsquo; The Highlander denies
the charge which our caricature tries to fasten on him; but even
granting that it was once to some extent justified, it is easy to
explain it by a reference to Gaelic, where the pronouns <i>se</i> and
<i>sibh</i>, for &lsquo;he&rsquo; and &lsquo;you&rsquo; respectively,
approach in pronunciation the sound of the English pronoun
&lsquo;she.&rsquo; This may have led to confusion in the mouths of
Highlanders who had but very imperfectly mastered English. In any case,
it is far too superficial to be quoted as a parallel to the <i>hi</i>,
&lsquo;she,&rsquo; in question in Welsh. A cautious Celtist, if such
there be, might warn us, before proceeding further with the search, to
make sure that the whole phenomenon is not a mere accident of Welsh
phonetics, and that it is not a case of two <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb644" href="#v2pb644" name=
"v2pb644">644</a>]</span>pronouns, one meaning &lsquo;she&rsquo; and
the other &lsquo;it,&rsquo; being confounded as the result merely of
phonetic decay. The answer to that is, that the language knows nothing
of any neuter pronoun which could assume the form of the <i>hi</i>
which occupies us; and further, that in locutions where the legitimate
representative of the neuter might be expected, the pronoun used is a
different one, <i>ef</i>, <i>e</i>, meaning both &lsquo;he&rsquo; and
&lsquo;it,&rsquo; as in <i>&iuml;-e</i> for <i>&iuml;-ef</i>, &lsquo;it
is he, she, it <i>or</i> they,&rsquo; <i>nag-e</i>, &lsquo;not he, she,
it <i>or</i> they,&rsquo; <i>ef a allai</i> or <i>fe allai</i>,
&lsquo;perhaps, peradventure, <i>peut-&ecirc;tre</i>, <i>il est
possible</i>.&rsquo; The French sentence suggests the analogous
question, what was the original force of denotation of the
&lsquo;il&rsquo; in such sentences as &lsquo;il fait beau,&rsquo;
&lsquo;il pleut,&rsquo; and &lsquo;il neige&rsquo;? In such cases it
now denotes nobody in particular, but has it always been one of his
names? French historical grammar may be able, unaided, to dispose of
the attenuated fortunes of M. <i>Il</i>, but we have to look for help
to the student of myth and allied subjects to enable us to identify the
great &lsquo;she&rsquo; persistently eluding our search in the syntax
of the Welsh language. Only two feminine names suggest themselves to me
as in any way appropriate: one is <i>tynghed</i>, &lsquo;fate or
fortune,&rsquo; and the other is <i>D&ocirc;n</i>, mother of some of
the most nebulous personages in Celtic literature.</p>
<p>There is, however, no evidence to show that either of them is really
the &lsquo;she&rsquo; of whom we are in quest; but I have something to
say about both as illustrating the other side of the theme, how the
study of language may help mythology. This I have so far only
illustrated by a reference to the equation of <span class="trans"
title="Zeus"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&Zeta;&epsilon;&#8059;&sigmaf;</span></span> with <i>Dyaus</i>
and their congeners. Within the range of Celtic legend the case is
similar with D&ocirc;n, who figures on Welsh ground, as I have hinted,
as mother of certain heroes of the oldest chapters of the
<i>Mabinogion</i>. For it is from her that Gwydion, the bard and
arch-magician, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb645" href=
"#v2pb645" name="v2pb645">645</a>]</span>Gofannon the smith his
brother, are called sons of D&ocirc;n; and so in the case of Arianrhod,
daughter of D&ocirc;n, mother of &#7930;ew, and owner of the sea-laved
castle of Caer Arianrhod, not far distant from the prehistoric mound of
Dinas Din&#7931;e, near the western mouth of the Menai Straits, as
already mentioned in another chapter, p. 208 above. In Irish legend, we
detect D&ocirc;n under the Irish form of her name, <i>Danu</i> or
<i>Donu</i>, genitive <i>Danann</i> or <i>Donann</i>, and she is almost
singular there in always being styled a divinity. From her the great
mythical personages of Irish legend are called <i>Tuatha D&eacute;
Danann</i>, or &lsquo;the Goddess Danu&rsquo;s Tribes,&rsquo; and
sometimes <i>Fir D&eacute;a</i>, or &lsquo;the Men of the
Divinity.&rsquo; The last stage in the Welsh history of D&ocirc;n
consists of her translation to the skies, where the constellation of
Cassiopeia is supposed to constitute <i>&#7930;ys D&ocirc;n</i> or
D&ocirc;n&rsquo;s Court, as the Corona Borealis is identified with
<i>Caer Arianrhod</i> or &lsquo;the Castle of D&ocirc;n&rsquo;s
Daughter&rsquo;; but, as was perhaps fitting, the dimensions of both
are reduced to comparative littleness by <i>Caer Gwydion</i>,
&lsquo;the Magician Gwydion&rsquo;s Battlements,&rsquo; spread over the
radiant expanse of the whole Milky Way<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e22418src" href="#xd26e22418" name="xd26e22418src">1</a>. Now the
identification of this ancient goddess Danu or D&ocirc;n as that in
whom the oldest legends of the Irish Goidels and the Welsh Goidels
converge, has been the work not so much of mythology as of the science
of language; for it was the latter that showed how to call back a
little colouring into the vanishing lineaments of this faded ancestral
divinity<a class="noteref" id="xd26e22424src" href="#xd26e22424" name=
"xd26e22424src">2</a>. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb646" href=
"#v2pb646" name="v2pb646">646</a>]</span></p>
<p>For my next illustration, namely <i>tynghed</i>, &lsquo;fate,&rsquo;
I would cite a passage from the opening of one of the most Celtic of
Welsh stories, that of Kulhwch and Olwen. Kulhwch&rsquo;s father, after
being for some time a widower, marries again, and conceals from his
second wife the fact that he has a son. She finds it out and lets her
husband know it; so he sends for his son Kulhwch, and the following is
the account of the son&rsquo;s interview with his stepmother, as given
in Lady Charlotte Guest&rsquo;s translation, ii. 252:&mdash;&lsquo;His
stepmother said unto him, &ldquo;It were well for thee to have a wife,
and I have a daughter who is sought of every man of renown in the
world.&rdquo; &ldquo;I am not of an age to wed,&rdquo; answered the
youth. Then said she unto him, &ldquo;I declare to thee, that it is thy
destiny not to be suited with a wife until thou obtain Olwen, the
daughter of Yspa&#273;aden Penkawr.&rdquo; And the youth blushed, and
the love of the maiden diffused itself through all his frame, although
he had never seen her. And his father inquired of him, &ldquo;What has
come over thee, my son, and what aileth thee?&rdquo; &ldquo;My
stepmother has declared to me, that I shall never have a wife until I
obtain Olwen, the daughter of Yspa&#273;aden Penkawr.&rdquo;
&ldquo;That will be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb647" href=
"#v2pb647" name="v2pb647">647</a>]</span>easy for thee,&rdquo; answered
his father. &ldquo;Arthur is thy cousin. Go, therefore, unto Arthur to
cut thy hair, and ask this of him as a boon.&rdquo;&#8202;&rsquo;</p>
<p>The physical theory of love for an unknown lady at the first mention
of her name, and the allusion to the Celtic tonsure, will have
doubtless caught the reader&rsquo;s attention, but I only wish to speak
of the words which the translator has rendered, &lsquo;I declare to
thee, that it is thy destiny not to be suited with a wife until thou
obtain Olwen.&rsquo; More closely rendered, the original might be
translated thus: &lsquo;I swear thee a destiny that thy side touch not
a wife till thou obtain Olwen.&rsquo; The word in the Welsh for destiny
is <i>tynghet</i> (for an earlier <i>tuncet</i>), and the corresponding
Irish word is attested as <i>tocad</i>. Both these words have a
tendency, like &lsquo;fate,&rsquo; to be used mostly <i>in peiorem
partem</i>. Formerly, however, they might be freely used in an
auspicious sense likewise, as for instance in the woman&rsquo;s name
<i>Tunccetace</i>, on an early inscribed stone in Pembrokeshire. If her
name had been rendered into Latin she would have probably been called
<i lang="la">Fortunata</i>, as a namesake of good fortune. I render the
Welsh <i lang="cy">mi a tynghaf dynghet itt</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e22517src" href="#xd26e22517" name="xd26e22517src">3</a> into
English, &lsquo;I swear thee a destiny&rsquo;; but, more literally
still, one might possibly render it &lsquo;I swear thee a
swearing,&rsquo; that is, &lsquo;I swear thee an oath,&rsquo; meaning
&lsquo;I swear for thee an oath which will bind thee.&rsquo; The
stepmother, it is true, is not represented going through the form of
words, for what she said appears to have been a regular formula, just
like that of putting a person in Medieval Irish story under
<i>gessa</i> or bonds of magic; but an oath or form of imprecation was
once doubtless a dark reality behind this <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb648" href="#v2pb648" name="v2pb648">648</a>]</span>formula. In the
southern part of my native county of Cardigan, the phrase in question
has been in use within the last thirty years, and the practice which it
denotes is still so well known as to be the subject of local stories. A
friend of mine, who is not yet fifty, vividly remembers listening to an
uncle of his relating how narrowly he once escaped having the oath
forced on him. He was in the hilly portion of the parish of
&#7930;anwenog, coming home across country in the dead of a
midsummer&rsquo;s night, when leaping over a fence he unexpectedly came
down close to a man actively engaged in sheep-stealing. The uncle
instantly took to his heels, while the thief pursued him with a knife.
If the thief had caught him, it is understood that he would have held
his knife at his throat and forced on him an oath of secrecy. I have
not been able to ascertain the wording of the oath, but all I can learn
goes to show that it was dreaded only less than death itself. In fact,
there are stories current of men who failed to recover from the effects
of the oath, but lingered and died in a comparatively short time. Since
I got the foregoing story I have made inquiries of others in South
Cardiganshire, and especially of a medical friend of mine, who speaks
chiefly as to his native parish of &#7930;angyn&#7931;o. I found that
the idea is perfectly familiar to him and my other informants; but,
strange to say, from nobody could I gather that the illness is
considered to result necessarily from the violent administration of the
<i>tynghed</i> to the victim, or from the latter&rsquo;s disregarding
the secrecy of it by disclosing to his friends the name of the
criminal. In fact, I cannot discover that any such secrecy is
emphasized so long as the criminal is not publicly brought before a
court of justice. Rather is it that the <i>tynghed</i> effects blindly
the ruin of the sworn man&rsquo;s health, regardless of his conduct. At
any rate, that is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb649" href=
"#v2pb649" name="v2pb649">649</a>]</span>the interpretation which I am
forced to put on what I have been told.</p>
<p>The phrase <i>tyngu tynghed</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e22548src"
href="#xd26e22548" name="xd26e22548src">4</a>, intelligible still in
Wales, recalls another instance of the importance of the spoken word,
to wit, the Latin <i>fatum</i>. Nay, it seems to suggest that the
latter might have perhaps originally been part of some such a formula
as <i lang="la">alicui fatum fari</i>, &lsquo;to say one a
saying,&rsquo; in the pregnant sense of applying to him words of power.
This is all the more to the point, as it is well known how closely
Latin and Celtic are related to one another, and how every advance in
the study of those languages goes to add emphasis to their kinship.
From the kinship of the languages one may expect, to a certain extent,
a similarity of rites and customs, and one has not to go further for
this than the very story which I have cited. When Kulhwch&rsquo;s
father first married, he is said to have sought a <i lang="cy">gwreic
kynmwyt ac ef</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e22590src" href=
"#xd26e22590" name="xd26e22590src">5</a>, which means &lsquo;a wife of
the same food with him.&rsquo; Thus the wedded wife was she, probably,
who ate with her husband, and we are reminded of the food ceremony
which constituted the aristocratic marriage in ancient Rome: it was
called <i>confarreatio</i>, and in the course of it an offering of
cake, called <i lang="la">farreum libum</i>, used to be made to
Jupiter. A great French student of antiquity, M. Fustel de Coulanges,
describes the ceremony thus<a class="noteref" id="xd26e22603src" href=
"#xd26e22603" name="xd26e22603src">6</a>:&mdash;&lsquo;<span lang=

quelques pri&egrave;res, et mangent ensemble un g&acirc;teau de fleur
de farine (<i lang="la">panis farreus</i>).</span>&rsquo; Lastly, my
attention has been directed to the place given to bread in the stories
of &#7930;yn y Fan Fach and &#7930;yn Elfarch. For on turning back to
pp. 3&ndash;6, 17&ndash;8, 28, the reader will find too much made of
the bread to allow us to suppose that it had no meaning in the
courtship. The young farmer having fallen in love at first sight with
the lake maiden, it looks as if he wished, by inducing her to share the
bread he was eating, to go forthwith through a form of marriage by a
kind of confarreation that committed her to a contract to be his wife
without any tedious delay.</p>
<p>To return to the Latin <i>fatum</i>, I would point out that the
Romans had a plurality of <i>fata</i>; but how far they were suggested
by the Greek <span class="trans" title="moirai"><span class="Greek"
lang="grc">&mu;&omicron;&#8150;&rho;&alpha;&iota;</span></span> is not
quite clear: nor is it known that the ancient Welsh had more than one
<i>tynghed</i>. In the case, however, of old Norse literature, we come
across the Fate there as one bearing a name which is perhaps cognate
with the Welsh <i>tynghed</i>. I allude to a female figure, called
&THORN;okk, who appears in the touching myth of Balder&rsquo;s death.
When Balder had fallen at the hands of Loki and H&ouml;&#273;r, his
mother Frigg asked who would like to earn her good will by going as her
messenger to treat with Hell for the release of Balder.
Herm&oacute;&#273;r the Swift, another of the sons of Woden, undertook
to set out on that journey on his father&rsquo;s charger Sleipnir. For
nine dreary nights he pursued his perilous course without interruption,
through glens dark and deep, till he came to the river called Yell,
when he was questioned as to his errand by the maid in charge of the
Yell bridge. On and on he rode afterwards till he came to the fence of
Hell&rsquo;s abode, which his horse cleared at full speed.
Herm&oacute;&#273;r entered the hall, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb651" href="#v2pb651" name="v2pb651">651</a>]</span>there found his
brother Balder seated in the place of honour. He abode with him that
night, and in the morning he asked Hell to let Balder ride home with
him to the Anses. He urged Hell to consider the grief which everybody
and everything felt for Balder. She replied that she would put that to
the test by letting Balder go if everything animate and inanimate would
weep for him; but he would be detained if anybody or anything declined
to do so. Herm&oacute;&#273;r made his way back alone to the Anses, and
announced to Frigg the answer which Hell had given to her request.
Messengers were sent forth without delay to bid all the world beweep
Woden&rsquo;s son out of the power of Hell. This was done accordingly
by all, by men and animals, by earth and stones, by trees and all
metals, &lsquo;as you have doubtless seen these things weep,&rsquo;
says the writer of the Prose Edda, &lsquo;when they pass from frost to
warmth.&rsquo; When the messengers, however, were on their way home,
after discharging their duty, they chanced on a cave where dwelt a
giantess called &THORN;okk, whom they ordered to join in the weeping
for Balder; but she only answered:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&THORN;okk will weep dry tears</p>
<p class="line xd26e2450">At Balder&rsquo;s bale-fire.</p>
<p class="line">What is the son of man, quick or dead, to me!</p>
<p class="line xd26e2450">Let Hell keep what she holds<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e22653src" href="#xd26e22653" name=
"xd26e22653src">7</a>.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">In this ogress &THORN;okk, deaf to the appeals of the
tenderer feelings, we seem to have the counterpart of our Celtic
<i>tocad</i> and <i>tynghed</i>; and the latter&rsquo;s name as a part
of the formula in the Welsh story, while giving us the key of the myth,
shows how the early Aryan knew of nothing <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb652" href="#v2pb652" name="v2pb652">652</a>]</span>more binding
than the magic force of an oath. On the one hand, this conception of
destiny carries with it the marks of its humble origin, and one readily
agrees with Cicero&rsquo;s words, <i lang="la">De Divinatione</i>, ii.
7, when he says, <i lang="la">anile sane et plenum superstitionis fati
nomen ipsum</i>. On the other hand, it rises to the grim dignity of a
name for the dark, inexorable power which the whole universe is
conceived to obey, a power before which the great and resplendent
<span class="trans" title="Zeus"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&Zeta;&epsilon;&#8059;&sigmaf;</span></span> of the Aryan race is
a mere puppet.</p>
<p>Perhaps I have dwelt only too long on the policy of &lsquo;give and
take&rsquo; which ought to obtain between mythology and glottology.
Unfortunately, one can add without fear of contradiction, that, even
when that policy is carried out to the utmost, both sciences will still
have difficulties more than enough. In the case of mythology these
difficulties spring chiefly from two distinct sources, from the
blending of history with myth, and from the mixing of one race with
another. Let us now consider the latter: the difficulties from this
source are many and great, but every fresh acquisition of knowledge
tending to make our ideas of ethnology more accurate, gives us a better
leverage for placing the myths of mixed peoples in their proper places
as regards the races composing those peoples. Still, we have far fewer
propositions to lay down than questions to ask: thus to go no further
afield than the well-known stories attaching to the name of Heracles,
how many of them are Aryan, how many Semitic, and how many Aryan and
Semitic at one and the same time? That is the sort of question which
besets the student of Celtic mythology at every step; for the Celtic
nations of the present day are the mixed descendants of Aryan invaders
and the native populations which those Aryan invaders found in
possession. So the question thrusts <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb653" href="#v2pb653" name="v2pb653">653</a>]</span>itself on the
student, to which of these races a particular myth, rite, or custom is
to be regarded as originally belonging. Take, for instance,
Br&acirc;n&rsquo;s colossal figure, to which attention has already been
called, pp. 552&ndash;3 above. Br&acirc;n was too large to enter a
house or go on board a ship: is he to be regarded as the outcome of
Celtic imagination, or of that of a people that preceded the Celts in
Celtic lands? The comparison with the Gaulish <i>Tricephal</i> would
seem to point in the direction of the southern seaboard of the Baltic
(p. 553): what then?</p>
<p>The same kind of question arises in reference to the Irish hero
C&uacute;chulainn: take, for instance, the stock description of
C&uacute;chulainn in a rage. Thus when angered he underwent strange
distortions: the calves of his legs came round to where his shins
should have been; his mouth enlarged itself so that it showed his liver
and lungs swinging in his throat; one of his eyes became as small as a
needle&rsquo;s, or else it sank back into his head further than a crane
could have reached, while the other protruded itself to a corresponding
length; every hair on his body became as sharp as a thorn, and held on
its point a drop of blood or a spark of fire. It would be dangerous
then to stop him from fighting, and even when he had fought enough, he
required for his cooling to be plunged into three baths of cold water;
the first into which he went would instantly boil over, the second
would be too hot for anybody else to bear, and the third only would be
of congenial warmth. I do not ask whether that strange picture betrays
a touch of the solar brush, but I should be very glad to know whether
it can be regarded as an Aryan creation or not.</p>
<p>It is much the same with matters other than mythological: take, for
instance, the bedlamite custom of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb654" href="#v2pb654" name=
"v2pb654">654</a>]</span>couvade<a class="noteref" id="xd26e22703src"
href="#xd26e22703" name="xd26e22703src">8</a>, which is presented to us
in Irish literature in the singular form of a <i>cess</i>,
&lsquo;suffering or indisposition,&rsquo; simultaneously attacking the
braves of ancient Ulster. We are briefly informed in the <i>Book of the
Dun Cow</i>, fo. 60<sup>a</sup>, that the women and boys of Ulster were
free from it. So was any Ultonian, we are told, who happened to be
outside the boundaries of his country, and so were C&uacute;chulainn
and his father, even when in Ulster. Any one who was rash enough to
attack an Ultonian warrior during this his period of helplessness could
not, it is further stated, expect to live afterwards either
prosperously or long. The question for us, however, is this: was the
couvade introduced by the Aryan invaders of Ireland, or are we rather
to trace it to an earlier race? I should be, I must confess, inclined
to the latter view, especially as the couvade was known among the
Iberians of old, and among the ancient Corsicans<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e22728src" href="#xd26e22728" name="xd26e22728src">9</a>. It may,
of course, have been both Aryan and Iberian, but it will all the same
serve as a specimen of the sort of question which one has to try to
answer. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb655" href="#v2pb655" name=
"v2pb655">655</a>]</span></p>
<p>Another instance, the race origin of which one would like to
ascertain, offers itself in the curious belief, that, when a child is
born, it is one of the ancestors of the family come back to live again.
Traces of this occur in Irish literature, namely, in one of the stories
about C&uacute;chulainn. There we read to the following
effect:&mdash;The Ultonians took counsel on account of
C&uacute;chulainn, because their wives and girls loved him greatly; for
C&uacute;chulainn had no consort at that time. This was their counsel,
namely, that they should seek for C&uacute;chulainn a consort pleasing
to him to woo. For it was evident to them that a man who has the
consort of his companionship with him would be so much the less likely
to attempt the ruin of their girls and to receive the affection of
their wives. Then, moreover, they were anxious and afraid lest the
death of C&uacute;chulainn should take place early, so they were
desirous for that reason to give him a wife in order that he might
leave an heir; for they knew that it was from himself that his rebirth
(<i>athgein</i>) would be. That is what one reads in the
eleventh-century copy of the ancient manuscript of the <i>Book of the
Dun Cow</i>, fo. 121<sup>b</sup>; and this atavistic belief, which was
touched upon in connexion with the transformations discussed in the
last chapter, I need scarcely say, is well known elsewhere to the
anthropologist, as one will find on consulting the opening pages of Dr.
Tylor&rsquo;s second volume on <i>Primitive Culture</i>. He there
mentions the idea as familiar to American Indians, to various African
peoples, to the Maoris and the aborigines of Australia, to Cheremiss
Tartars and Lapps. Among such nations the words of Don Di&egrave;gue to
his victorious son, the Cid, could hardly fail to be construed in a
sort of literal sense when he exclaims:&mdash;</p>
<div lang="fr" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; ton illustre
audace</p>
<p class="line">Fait bien revivre en toi les h&eacute;ros de ma
race.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb656" href="#v2pb656" name=
"v2pb656">656</a>]</span></p>
<p>Let us return to C&uacute;chulainn, and note the statement, that he
and his father, Sualdaim, were exempt from the couvade, which marks
them out as not of the same race as the Ultonians, that is to say, as
the <i>F&iacute;r Ulaid</i>, or &lsquo;True
Ultonians&rsquo;&mdash;presumably ancient inhabitants of Ulster.
Furthermore, we have an indication whence his family had come, for
C&uacute;chulainn&rsquo;s first name was <i>Setanta Beg</i>, &lsquo;the
Little Setantian,&rsquo; which points to the coast of what is now
Lancashire, as already indicated at p. 385 above. Another thing which
marks C&uacute;chulainn as of a different racial origin from the other
Ultonians is the belief of the latter, that his rebirth must be from
himself. The meaning of this remarkable statement is that there were
two social systems face to face in Ulster at the time represented by
the C&uacute;chulainn story, and that one of them recognized
fatherhood, while the other did not. Thus for C&uacute;chulainn&rsquo;s
rebirth to be from himself, he must be the father of a child from whom
should descend a man who would be a rebirth or avatar of
C&uacute;chulainn. The other system implied was one which reckoned
descent by birth alone<a class="noteref" id="xd26e22760src" href=
"#xd26e22760" name="xd26e22760src">10</a>; and the C&uacute;chulainn
story gives one the impression that it contemplated this system as the
predominant one, while the C&uacute;chulainn family, with its reckoning
of fatherhood, comes in as an exception. At all events, that is how I
now understand a passage, the full significance of which had till
recently escaped me.</p>
<p>Allusion has already been made to the story of C&uacute;chulainn
being himself a rebirth, namely, of Lug, and the story deserves still
further consideration in its bearing on the question of race, to which
the reader&rsquo;s attention has been called. It is needless, however,
to say that there are extant fragments of more stories than
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb657" href="#v2pb657" name=
"v2pb657">657</a>]</span>one as to C&uacute;chulainn&rsquo;s origin.
Sometimes, as in the <i>Book of Leinster</i>, fo. 119<sup>a</sup>, he
is called <i>gein Loga</i>, or Lug&rsquo;s offspring, and in the epic
tale of the T&aacute;in B&oacute; Cuailnge, Lug as his father comes
from the <i>S&iacute;d</i> or Faery to take C&uacute;chulainn&rsquo;s
place in the field, when the latter was worn out with sleeplessness and
toil. Lug sings over him <i>&eacute;li Loga</i>, or &lsquo;Lug&rsquo;s
enchantment,&rsquo; and C&uacute;chulainn gets the requisite rest and
sleep<a class="noteref" id="xd26e22787src" href="#xd26e22787" name=
"xd26e22787src">11</a>: this we read in the <i>Book of the Dun Cow</i>,
fo. 78<sup>a</sup>. In another version of the story, C&uacute;chulainn
is an incarnation of Lug: the narrative relates how a foster-son was
accepted by Dechtere, sister to Conchobar MacNessa, king of Ulster. But
her foster-son died <span class="corr" id="xd26e22805" title=
"Source: youug">young</span>, to the great grief of Dechtere; and her
lamentations for him on the day of his funeral having made her thirsty,
she inadvertently swallowed with her drink a diminutive creature which
sprang into her mouth. That night she had a dream, in which a man
informed her that she was pregnant, that it was he who was in her womb,
that he had been her foster-son, and that he was Lug; also that when
his birth should take place, the name was to be Setanta. After an
incident which I can only regard as a clumsy attempt to combine the
more primitive legend with the story which makes him son of Sualdaim,
she gives birth to the boy, and he is duly called Setanta<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e22808src" href="#xd26e22808" name=
"xd26e22808src">12</a>: that was C&uacute;chulainn&rsquo;s first name.
Now compare this with what Dr. Tylor mentions in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb658" href="#v2pb658" name=
"v2pb658">658</a>]</span>the case of the Lapps, namely, that &lsquo;the
future mother was told in a dream what name to give her child, this
message being usually given her by the very spirit of the deceased
ancestor, who was about to be incarnate in her<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e22829src" href="#xd26e22829" name="xd26e22829src">13</a>.&rsquo;
If the mother got no such intimation in a dream, the relatives of the
child had to have recourse to magic and the aid of the wise man, to
discover the name to be given to the child.</p>
<p>Here let it suffice to say, that the similarity is so close between
the Irish and the Lapp idea, and so unlike anything known to have been
Aryan, that it is well worth bearing in mind. The belief in rebirth
generally seems to fit as a part of the larger belief in the
transmigration of souls which is associated with the teachings of the
ancient druids, a class of shamans or medicine-men who were probably,
as already hinted, not of Celtic or Aryan origin; and probably the
beliefs here in question were those of some non-Aryan people of these
islands, rather than of any Aryans who settled in them. This view need
hardly be regarded as incompatible with the fact, that Lug&rsquo;s
name, genitive <i>Loga</i>, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb659"
href="#v2pb659" name="v2pb659">659</a>]</span>would seem to have meant
light, and that Lug was a sun-god, very possibly a Celtic sun-god: or
more correctly speaking, that there was a series of Lugs, so to say, or
sun-gods, called in ancient Spain, Switzerland, and on the banks of the
Rhine, <i>Lugoves</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e22868src" href=
"#xd26e22868" name="xd26e22868src">14</a>. For one is sorely tempted to
treat this much as a rescue from the wreckage of the solar myth theory,
as against those who, having regard mainly to Lug&rsquo;s professional
skill and craft as described in Irish story, make of him a kind of
Hermes or Mercury. In other words, we have either to regard a Celtic
Lug as having become the centre of certain non-Celtic legends, or else
to suppose neither Lug nor his name to be of Aryan origin at all. It is
hard to say which is the sounder view to take.</p>
<p>The next question which I wish to suggest is as to the ethnology of
the fairies; but before coming to that, one has to ask how the fairies
have been evolved. The idea of fairies, such as Welshmen have been
familiar with from their childhood, clearly involves elements of two
distinct origins. Some of those elements come undoubtedly from the
workshop of the imagination, as, for example, the stock notion that
their food and drink are brought to the fairies by the mere force of
wishing, and without the ministration of servants; or the notion,
especially prevalent in Arfon, that the fairies dwell in a country
beneath the lakes of Snowdon; not to mention the more general connexion
of a certain class of fairies with the world of waters, as indicated in
chapter vii. Add to this that the dead ancestor has also probably
contributed to our bundle of notions about them; but that contains also
an element of fact or something which may at any rate be conceived as
historical. Under this head I should place <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb660" href="#v2pb660" name=
"v2pb660">660</a>]</span>the following articles of faith concerning
them: the sallowness of their skins and the smallness of their stature,
their dwelling underground, their dislike of iron, and the comparative
poverty of their homes in the matter of useful articles of furniture,
their deep-rooted objection to the green sward being broken up by the
plough, the success of the fairy wife in attending to the domestic
animals and to the dairy, the limited range generally of the
fairies&rsquo; ability to count; and lastly, one may perhaps mention
their using a language of their own (p. 279), which would imply a time
when the little people understood no other, and explain why they should
be represented doing their marketing without uttering a syllable to
anybody (p. 161).</p>
<p>The attribution of these and similar characteristics to the fairies
can scarcely be all mere feats of fancy and imagination: rather do they
seem to be the result of our ancestors projecting on an imaginary world
a primitive civilization through which tradition represented their own
race as having passed, or, more probably, a civilization in which they
saw, or thought they saw, another race actually living. Let us recur
for examples also to the two lake legends which have just been
mentioned (p. 650): in both of them a distinction is drawn between the
lake fairy&rsquo;s notion of bread and that of the men and women of the
country. To the fairy the latter&rsquo;s bread appeared crimped or
overbaked: possibly the backward civilization, to which she was
supposed to belong, was content to support itself on some kind of
unleavened bread, if not rather on a fare which included nothing
deserving to be called bread at all. Witness Giraldus Cambrensis&rsquo;
story of Eliodorus, in which bread is conspicuous by its absence, the
nearest approach to it being something of the consistency of porridge:
see p. 270 above. Then take another order of ideas: the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb661" href="#v2pb661" name=
"v2pb661">661</a>]</span>young man in both lake legends lives with his
mother (pp. 3, 27): there is no father to advise or protect him: he is
in this respect on a level with Undine, who is the protegee of her
tiresome uncle, K&uuml;hleborn. Seemingly, he belongs to a primitive
society where matriarchal ideas rule, and where paternity is not
reckoned<a class="noteref" id="xd26e22885src" href="#xd26e22885" name=
"xd26e22885src">15</a>. This we are at liberty at all events to suppose
to have been the original, before the narrator had painted the mother a
widow, and given the picture other touches of his later brush.</p>
<p>To speak, however, of paternity as merely not reckoned is by no
means to go far enough; so here we have to return to take another look
at the imaginary aspect of the fairies, to which a cursory allusion has
just been made. The reader will possibly recall the sturdy smith of
Ystrad Meurig, who would not reduce the notions which he had formed of
the fairies when he was a child to conformity with those of a later
generation around him. In any case, he will remember the smith&rsquo;s
statement that <i>the fairies were all women</i>: see p. 245. The idea
was already familiar to me as a Welshman, though I cannot recollect how
I got it. But the smith&rsquo;s words brought to my mind at once the
story of Condla R&uacute;ad or the Red, one of the fairy tales first
recorded in Irish literature (p. 291). There the damsel who takes
Condla away in her boat of glass to the realm of the Everliving sings
the praises of that delectable country, and uses, among others, the
following words, which occur in the <i>Book of the Dun Cow</i>, fo.
120:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>Ni fil cenel and namm&aacute; acht mn&aacute; ocus

</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">There is no race there but women and maidens alone.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb662" href="#v2pb662" name=
"v2pb662">662</a>]</span></p>
<p>Now what people could have come by the idea of a race of women only?
Surely no people who considered that they themselves had fathers: it
must have been some community so low in the scale of civilization as
never to have had any notion whatsoever of paternity: it is their
ignorance that would alone render possible the notion of a race all
women. That this was a matter of belief in the past of many nations, is
proved by the occurrence of widely known legends about virgin
mothers<a class="noteref" id="xd26e22941src" href="#xd26e22941" name=
"xd26e22941src">17</a>; not to mention that it has been lately
established, that there are savages who to this day occupy the low
place here indicated in the scale of civilization. Witness the evidence
of Spencer and Gillen in their recently published work on <i>The Native
Tribes of Central Australia</i>, and also what Frazer, author of <i>The
Golden Bough</i>, says of a passage in point, in the former, as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thus, in the opinion of these savages, every conception is
what we are wont to call an immaculate conception, being brought about
by the entrance into the mother of a spirit apart from any contact with
the other sex. Students of folklore have long been familiar with
notions of this sort occurring in the stories of the birth of
miraculous personages, but this is the first case on record of a tribe
who believe in immaculate conception as the sole cause of the birth of
every human being who comes into the world. A people so ignorant of the
most elementary of natural <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb663" href=
"#v2pb663" name="v2pb663">663</a>]</span>processes may well rank at the
very bottom of the savage scale<a class="noteref" id="xd26e22960src"
href="#xd26e22960" name="xd26e22960src">18</a>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is to some population in that low position, in the
remote prehistory of this country, that one is to trace the belief that
the fairies were all women. It is to be regarded as a position
distinctly lower than that of the Ultonians in the time of
C&uacute;chulainn; for the couvade seems to me to argue a notion of
paternity&mdash;perhaps, in their case, as clear a notion of paternity
as was possible for a community which was not quite out of the
promiscuous stage of society.</p>
<p>The neo-Celtic nations of these islands consist, speaking roughly,
of a mixture of the invading Celts with the earlier inhabitants whom
the Celts found in possession. These two or more groups of peoples may
have been in very different stages of civilization when they first came
in contact with one another. They agreed doubtless in many things, and
perhaps, among others, in cherishing an inherited reluctance to
disclose their names, but the Celts as Aryans were never without the
decimal system of counting. Like the French, the Celtic nations of the
present day show a tendency, more or less marked, to go further and
count by scores instead of by tens. But the Welsh are alone among them
in having, in certain <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb664" href=
"#v2pb664" name="v2pb664">664</a>]</span>instances, gone back from
counting by tens to counting by fives, which they do when they count
between 10 and 20: for 16, 17, 18, and 19 are in Welsh 1 on 15, 2 on
15, 3 on 15, and 4 on 15 respectively; and similarly with 13 and
14<a class="noteref" id="xd26e22972src" href="#xd26e22972" name=
"xd26e22972src">19</a>. We have seen how the lake fairy reckoned by
fives (pp. 8, 418) all the live stock she was to have as her dowry; and
one otherwise notices that the fairies deal invariably in the simplest
of numbers. Thus if you wish, for example, to find a person who has
been led away by them, ten to one you have to go &lsquo;this day next
year&rsquo; to the spot where he disappeared. Except in the case of the
alluring light of the full moon, it is out of the question to reckon
months or weeks, though it is needless to say that to reckon the year
correctly would have been in point of fact far more difficult; but
nothing sounds simpler than &lsquo;this day next year.&rsquo; In that
simple arithmetic of the fairies, then, we seem to have a trace of a
non-Aryan race, that is to say, probably of some early inhabitants of
these islands.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the language of those inhabitants has died out, so
that we cannot appeal to its numerals directly; and the next best
course to adopt is to take as a sort of substitute for their language
that of possible kinsmen of a pre-Celtic race in this country. Now the
students of ethnology, especially those devoted to the investigation of
skulls and skins, tell us that we have among us, notably in Wales and
Ireland, living representatives of a dark-haired, long-skulled race of
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb665" href="#v2pb665" name=
"v2pb665">665</a>]</span>same description as one of the types which
occur, as they allege, among the Basque populations of the Pyrenees. We
turn accordingly to Basque, and what do we find? Why, that the first
five numerals in that language are <i>bat</i>, <i>bi</i>, <i>iru</i>,
<i>lau</i>, <i>bost</i>, all of which appear to be native; but when we
come to the sixth numeral we have <i>sei</i>, which looks like an Aryan
word borrowed from Latin, Gaulish, or some related tongue. The case is
much the same with &lsquo;seven,&rsquo; for that is in Basque
<i>zazpi</i>, which is also probably an Aryan loan-word. Basque has
native words, <i>zortzi</i> and <i>bederatzi</i>, for eight and nine,
but they are longer than the first five, and appear to be of a later
formation affecting, in common with <i>sei</i> and <i>zazpi</i>, the
termination <i>i</i>. I submit, therefore, that here we have evidence
of the former existence of a people in the West of Europe who at one
time only counted as far as five. Some of the early peoples of the
British Isles may have been on the same level, so that our notions
about the fairies have probably been derived, to a greater or less
extent, from ideas formed by the Celts concerning those non-Celtic,
non-Aryan natives of whose country they took possession.</p>
<p>As regards my appeal to the authority of craniology, I have to
confess that it is made with a certain amount of reservation, since the
case is far less simple than it looks at first sight. Thus, in August,
1891, the Cambrian Arch&aelig;ological Association, including among
them Professor Sayce, visited the south-west of Ireland. During our
pleasant excursions in Kerry, the question of race was one of our
constant topics; and Professor Sayce was reminded by what he saw in
Ireland of his visit to North Africa, especially the hilly regions of
the country inhabited by the Berbers. Among other things, he used to
say that if a number of Berbers from the mountains were to be brought
to an Irish village and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb666" href=
"#v2pb666" name="v2pb666">666</a>]</span>clad as Irishmen, he felt
positive that he should not be able to tell them from the Irishmen
themselves, such as we saw on our rambles in Kerry. This struck me as
all the more remarkable, since his reference was to fairly tall,
blue-eyed men whose hair could not be called black. On the other hand,
owing perhaps to ignorance and careless ways of looking at things
around me, I am a little sceptical as to the swarthy long-skulls: they
did not seem to meet us at every turn in Ireland; and as for Wales,
which I know as well as most people do, I cannot in my ignorance of
craniology say with any confidence that I have ever noticed vast
numbers of that type. I should like, however, to see the heads of some
of the singers whom I have noticed at our Eiste&#273;fodau at Cardiff,
Aberdare, and Swansea, placed under the hands of an experienced
skull-man. For I have long suspected that we cannot regard as of Aryan
origin the vocal talent so general in Wales, and so conspicuous in our
choirs of working people as to astonish all the great musicians who
have visited our national festival. Beyond all doubt, race has not a
little to do with the artistic feelings: a short-skull may be as
unmusical, for example, as I am; but has anybody in this country ever
known a narrow long-skull to be the reverse of unmusical? or has any
one ever considered how few clergymen of the tall, fair-haired,
blue-eyed type have been converted to the ritualistic and
&aelig;sthetic movement in the Church of England?</p>
<p>As it seems to me that the bulk of the Welsh people would have to be
described as short-skulls, it would be very gratifying to see those who
are wont to refer freely to the dark-complexioned long-skulls of Wales
catch a respectable number of specimens. I trust there are plenty to be
found; and of course I do not care how they are taken, whether it be by
an instantaneous process <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb667" href=
"#v2pb667" name="v2pb667">667</a>]</span>of photography or in the
meshes of some anthropometric sportsman, like Dr. Beddoe. Let them be
secured anyhow, so that one may rest assured that the type is still
numerically safe, and be able to judge with one&rsquo;s own eyes how
heads long and swarthy look on the shoulders of living Welshmen. We
might then be in a position also to compare with them the prevalent
description of fairy changelings; for when the fairies steal nice,
blond babies, they usually place in their stead their own aged-looking
brats with short legs, sallow skins, and squeaky voices. Unfortunately
for me, all the adult changelings of whom I happen to have heard any
account had died some years before I began to turn my attention to the
population of Faery, with the exception, perhaps, of one whose name I
obtained under the seal of secrecy. It was that of the wife of a farmer
living near Nefyn, in West Carnarvonshire. It was whispered that she
was a changeling, so I am inclined to regard her as no other than one
of the representatives of the same aboriginal stock to which one might
conjecture some of her neighbours also to belong; she ought to be an
extreme specimen of the type. It is to be hoped that the photographer
and his anthropometric brother have found her out in time and in good
humour; but it is now many years since I heard of her.</p>
<p>To return again to the fairies, some of them are described as more
comely and good-looking than the rest (pp. 83, 250), but the fairy
women are always pictured as fascinating, though their offspring as
changelings are as uniformly presented in the light of repulsive
urchins; but whole groups of the fairy population are sometimes
described as being as ugly of face as they were thievish in
disposition&mdash;those, for instance, of &#7930;anfabon, in
Glamorganshire (p. 262). There is one district, however, which is an
exception to the tenor <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb668" href=
"#v2pb668" name="v2pb668">668</a>]</span>of fairy physiognomy: it is
that of the Pennant neighbourhood, in Carnarvonshire, together with the
hills and valleys, roughly speaking, from Cwm Stra&#7931;yn to
&#7930;wytmor and from Drws y Coed to Dolbenmaen. The fairies of that
tract are said to have been taller than the others, and characterized
by light or even flaxen hair, together with eyes of clear blue: see pp.
89, 93&ndash;7, 105&ndash;8. Nor is that all, for we are told that they
would not let a person of dark complexion come near them (p. 96). The
other fairies, when kidnapping, it is true, preferred the blond infants
of other people to their own swarthy brats, which, perhaps, means that
it was a policy of their people to recruit itself with men of the
superior physique of the more powerful population around them. The
supposed fairy ancestress of the people of the Pennant Valley bears, in
the stories in point, such names as Penelope, Bella, Pelisha, and Sibi,
while her descendants are still taunted with their descent&mdash;a
quarrel which, within living memory, used to be fought out with fists
at the fairs at Penmorfa and elsewhere. This seems to indicate a
comparatively late settlement<a class="noteref" id="xd26e23042src"
href="#xd26e23042" name="xd26e23042src">20</a> in the district of a
family or group of families from without, and an origin, therefore,
somewhat similar to that of the <i>Simychiaid</i> and <i>Cowperiaid</i>
(p. 67) of a more eastern portion of the same county, rather than
anything deserving to be considered with the rest of the annals of
Faery. Passing by this oasis, then, such snap-shot photographs as I
have been able to take, so to speak, of fairyland cleared of the
glamour resting on its landscape, seem to disclose to the eye a swarthy
population of short stumpy men occupying the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb669" href="#v2pb669" name=
"v2pb669">669</a>]</span>most inaccessible districts of our country.
They appear to have cared more for soap than clothing<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e23057src" href="#xd26e23057" name="xd26e23057src">21</a>, and
they lived on milk taken once a day, when they could get it. They
probably fished and hunted, and kept domestic animals, including,
perhaps, the pig; but they depended largely on what they could steal at
night or in misty weather. Their thieving, however, was not resented,
as their visits were believed to bring luck and prosperity (p. 251).
Their communities formed as it were islands, owing to the country round
about them having been wrested from them by later comers of a more
warlike disposition and provided with better weapons. But the existence
of the scattered groups of the fairies was in no danger of coming to a
violent end: they were safe in consequence of the superstitious beliefs
of their stronger neighbours, who probably regarded them as formidable
magicians, powerful, among other things, to cause or to cure disease as
they pleased. Such, without venturing to refresh my memory by perusing
what has been written about dwarf races in other parts of the world,
are the impressions made on my mind in the course of analysing and
sifting the folklore materials crowded into this volume. That applies,
of course, in so far only as regards the fairies in their character of
a real people as distinguished from them as creatures of the
imagination. But, as I have no wish to earn the displeasure of my
literary friends, let me hasten to say that I acknowledge the latter,
the creatures of the imagination, to be the true fairies, the
admiration of one&rsquo;s childhood and the despair of one&rsquo;s
later years: the other folk&mdash;the aborigines whom I have been
trying to depict&mdash;form only <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb670"
href="#v2pb670" name="v2pb670">670</a>]</span>a sort of substratum, a
kind of background to the fairy picture, which I should be the last man
to wish to mar.</p>
<p>It is needless to say that we have no trace of any fairies
approaching the minute dimensions of Shakespeare&rsquo;s Queen Mab;
for, after all, our fairies are mostly represented as not extravagantly
unlike other people in personal appearance&mdash;not so unlike, in
fact, that other folk might not be mistaken for them now and then as
late as the latter part of the fifteenth century. Witness the following
passage from Sir John Wynne&rsquo;s <i>History of the Gwydir
Family</i>, p. 74:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Haveing purchased this lease, he removed his dwelling to the
castle of Dolwy&#273;elan, which at that time was in part thereof
habitable, where one Howell ap Jevan ap Rys Gethin, in the beginning of
Edward the Fourth his raigne, captaine of the countrey and an outlaw,
had dwelt. Against this man David ap Jenkin rose, and contended with
him for the sovreignety of the countrey; and being superiour to him, in
the end he drew a draught for him, and took him in his bed at Penanmen
with his concubine, performing by craft, what he could not by force,
and brought him to Conway Castle. Thus, after many bickerings betweene
Howell and David ap Jenkin, he being too weake, was faigne to flie the
countrey, and to goe to Ireland, where he was a yeare or thereabouts.
In the end he returned in the summer time, haveing himselfe, and all
his followers clad in greene, who, being come into the countrey, he
dispersed here and there among his friends, lurking by day, and
walkeing in the night for feare of his adversaries; and such of the
countrey as happened to have a sight of him and his followers, said
they were the fairies, and soe ran away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But what has doubtless helped, above all other things, to perpetuate
the belief in the existence of fairies may <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb671" href="#v2pb671" name=
"v2pb671">671</a>]</span>be said to be the popular association with
them of the circles in the grass, commonly known in English as fairy
rings. This phenomenon must have answered for ages the purpose for our
ancestors, practically speaking, of ocular demonstration, as it still
does no doubt in many a rustic neighbourhood.</p>
<p>The most common name for the fairies in Welsh is <i>y Tylwyth
Teg</i>, &lsquo;the Fair or Beautiful Family&rsquo;; but in South
Cardiganshire we have found them called <i>Plant Rhys &#272;wfn</i>,
&lsquo;the Children of Rhys the Deep&rsquo; (pp. 151, 158), while in
Gwent and Morgannwg they are more usually known as <i lang="cy">Bendith
y Mamau</i>, &lsquo;the Blessing of the Mothers&rsquo; (p. 174). Our
fourteenth century poet, D. ab Gwilym, uses the first-mentioned term,
<i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i>, in poem xxxix, and our prose literature
has a word <i>corr</i>, <i>cor</i> in the sense of a dwarf, and
<i>corres</i> for a she dwarf. The old Cornish had also <i>cor</i>,
which in Breton is written <i>korr</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e23102src" href="#xd26e23102" name="xd26e23102src">22</a>, with a
feminine <i>korrez</i>, and among the other derivatives one finds
<i>korrik</i>, &lsquo;a dwarf, a fairy, a wee little sorcerer,&rsquo;
and <i>korrigez</i> or <i>korrigan</i>, &lsquo;a she dwarf, a fairy
woman, a diminutive sorceress.&rsquo; The use of these words in Breton
recalls the case of the <i>cor</i>, called Rhu&#273;lwm or <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb672" href="#v2pb672" name=
"v2pb672">672</a>]</span>else Ei&#273;ilig, teaching his magic to
Co&#7931;, son of Co&#7931;frewi: see pp. 326, 503, 505. Then we have
uncanny dwarfs in the romances, such, for example, as the rude
<i>cor</i> in the service of Edern ab Nu&#273;, as described in French
in Chr&eacute;tien&rsquo;s romance of <i>Erec et Enide</i> and in Welsh
in that of <i>Gereint vab Erbin</i>, also the <i>cor</i> and
<i>corres</i> who figure in the story of Peredur. The latter had
belonged to that hero&rsquo;s father and mother till the break-up of
the family, when the dwarfs went to Arthur&rsquo;s Court, where they
lived a whole year without speaking to anybody. When, however, Peredur
made his rustic appearance there, they hailed him loudly as the chief
of warriors and the flower of knighthood, which brought on them the
wrath of Cai, on whom they were eventually avenged by Peredur. In the
case<a class="noteref" id="xd26e23205src" href="#xd26e23205" name=
"xd26e23205src">23</a> of both Edern and Peredur we find the dwarfs
loyally interested in the fortunes of their masters and their
masters&rsquo; friends. With them also the shape-shifting Menw, though
not found placed in the same unfavourable light, is probably to be
ranged, as one may gather from his name and his r&ocirc;le of wizard
scout for Arthur&rsquo;s men (p. 510). In the like attachment on the
part of the fairies, which was at times liable to develop into
devotedness of an embarrassing nature (p. 250), we seem to have one of
the germs of the idea of a household fairy or <i>banshee</i>, as
illustrated by the case of the ugly wee woman in the Pantannas legend
(p. 188); and it seems natural to regard the interested voices in the
Kenfig legend, and other stories of the same kind (p. 452), as
instances of amalgamating the idea of a fairy with that of an ancestral
person.</p>
<p>At all events, we have obtained something to put by the side of the
instances already noticed of the fairy <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb673" href="#v2pb673" name="v2pb673">673</a>]</span>girl who gives,
against her will at first, her services in the dairy of her captor (pp.
45, 87); of the other fairy who acts as a nurse for a family in the
Pennant Valley, till she is asked to dress better (p. 109); and of
Bwca&rsquo;r Trwyn who works willingly and well, both at the house and
in the field, till he has tricks played on him (pp. 593&ndash;6). To
make this brief survey complete, one has to mention the fairies who
used to help Eilian with her spinning (pp. 211&ndash;3), and not to
omit those who were found to come to the rescue of a woman in despair
and to assist her on the condition of getting her baby. The motive here
is probably not to be confounded with that of the fairies who
stealthily exchanged babies: the explanation seems in this case to be
that the fairies, or some of the fairies, were once regarded as
cannibals, which is countenanced by such a story as that of Canrig Bwt,
&lsquo;Canrig the Stumpy.&rsquo; At &#7930;anberis the latter is said
to have lived beneath the huge stone called <i>y Gromlech</i>,
&lsquo;the Dolmen,&rsquo; opposite Cwmglas and near the high-road to
the Pass. When the man destined to dispatch her came, she was just
finishing her dinner off a baby&rsquo;s flesh. There are traces of a
similar story in another district, for a writer who published in the
year 1802 uses the following words:&mdash;&lsquo;There was lately near
Cerrig y Drudion, in Merionethshire, a subterraneous room composed of
large stones, which was called <i>Carchar Cynric Rwth</i>, i. e.
&ldquo;The Prison of Cynric Rwth,&rdquo; which has been taken notice of
by travellers.&rsquo; Cynric Rwth may be rendered &lsquo;Cynric the
Greedy or Broad-mouthed.&rsquo; A somewhat similar ogress is located by
another story on the high ground at Bwlch y Rhiw Felen, on the way from
&#7930;ango&#7931;en to &#7930;andegla, and she is represented by the
local tradition as contemporary with Arthur<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e23230src" href="#xd26e23230" name="xd26e23230src">24</a>. I am
inclined to think the Cwmglas cromlech <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb674" href="#v2pb674" name="v2pb674">674</a>]</span>natural rather
than artificial; but I am, however, struck by the fact that the fairies
are not unfrequently located on or near ancient sites, such as seem to
be Corwrion (pp. 57, 526), the margin of &#7930;yn Ir&#273;yn (pp. 148,
563), Bryn y Pibion (pp. 212&ndash;4), Din&#7931;aen (p. 227), Carn
Bod&uuml;an (p. 227), on which there are, I am told, walls and hut
foundations similar to those which I have recently seen on Carn Fadrun
in the same district, Moe&#273;in camp (p. 245), and, perhaps, Ynys
Geinon Rock and the immediate vicinity of Craig y Nos, neither of
which, however, have I ever visited (p. 254). Local acquaintance with
each fairy centre would very possibly enable one to produce a list that
would be suggestive.</p>
<p>In passing one may point out that the uncanny dwarf of Celtic story
would seem to have served, in one way or another, as a model for other
dwarfs in the French romances and the literatures of other nations that
came under the influence of those romances, such as that of the
English. But the subject is too large to be dealt with here; so I
return to the word <i>cor</i>, in order to recall to the reader&rsquo;s
mind the allusion made, at p. 196, to a certain people called
<i>Coranneit</i> or <i>Coranyeit</i>, pronounced in later Welsh
<i>Cor&aacute;ni&#815;aid</i>, &lsquo;Corannians.&rsquo; They come in
the Adventure of &#7930;&ucirc;&#273; and &#7930;evelys, and there they
have ascribed to them one of the characteristics of consummate
magicians, namely, the power of hearing any word that comes in contact
with the wind; so it was, we are told, impossible <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb675" href="#v2pb675" name=
"v2pb675">675</a>]</span>to harm them. &#7930;&ucirc;&#273;, however,
was advised to circumvent them in the following manner:&mdash;he was to
bruise certain insects in water and sprinkle the water on the
Corannians and his own people indiscriminately, after calling them
together under the pretence of making peace between them; for the
sprinkling would do no harm to his own subjects, while it would kill
the others. This unholy water proved effective, and the Corannians all
perished. Now the magic power ascribed to them, and the method of
disposing of them, combine to lend them a fabulous aspect, while their
name, inseparable as it seems from <i>cor</i>, &lsquo;a dwarf,&rsquo;
warrants us in treating them as fairies, and in regarding their strange
characteristics as induced on a real people. If we take this view, that
<i>Coraniaid</i> was the name of a real people, we are at liberty to
regard it as possible, that their name suggested to the Celts the word
<i>cor</i> for a dwarf, rather than that <i>cor</i> has suggested the
name of the Corannians. In either case, I may mention that Welsh
writers have sometimes thought&mdash;and they are probably
right&mdash;that we have a closely related word in the name of
Ptolemy&rsquo;s <i>Coritani</i> or <i>Coritavi</i>. He represents the
people so called as dwelling, roughly speaking, between the Trent and
Norfolk, and possessed of the two towns of <i>Lindum</i>,
&lsquo;Lincoln,&rsquo; and <i>Rat&aelig;</i> (p. 547), supposed to have
been Leicester. There we should have accordingly to suppose the old
race to have survived so long and in such numbers, that the Celtic
lords of southern Britain called the people of that area by a name
meaning dwarfs. There also they may be conjectured to have had quiet
from invaders from the Continent, because of the inaccessible nature of
the fens, and the lack of inviting harbours on the coast from the
country of the Iceni up to the neighbourhood of the Humber. How far
their territory extended inland from the fens and the sea one
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb676" href="#v2pb676" name=
"v2pb676">676</a>]</span>cannot say, but it possibly took in one-half
of what is now Northamptonshire, with the place called <i>Pytchley</i>,
from an older <i>Pihtes L&eacute;a</i>, meaning the Meadow of the Pict,
or else of a man named Pict. In any case it included Croyland in the
fens between Peterborough and the Wash. It was there, towards the end
of the seventh century, that St. Guthlac built his cell on the side of
an ancient mound or tumulus, and it was there he was assailed by demons
who spoke <i>Bryttisc</i> or Brythonic, a language which the saint
knew, as he had been an exile among Brythons. For this he had probably
not to travel far; and it is remarkable that his father&rsquo;s
<i>cognomen</i> or surname was <i>Penwall</i>, which we may regard as
approximately the Brythonic for &lsquo;Wall&rsquo;s End.&rsquo; That is
to say, he was &lsquo;So-and-so of the Wall&rsquo;s End,&rsquo; and had
got to be known by the latter designation instead of his own
<i>nomen</i>, which is not recorded, for the reason, possibly, that it
was so Brythonic as not to admit of being readily reduced into an
Anglian or Latin form. It is not quite certain that he belonged to the
royal race of Mercia, whose genealogy, however, boasts such un-English
names as Pybba, Penda, and Peada; but the life<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e23312src" href="#xd26e23312" name="xd26e23312src">25</a> states,
with no little emphasis, that he was a man whose pedigree included the
most noble names of illustrious kings from the ancient stock of Icel:
that is, he was one of the <i>Iclingas</i> or Icklings<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e23321src" href="#xd26e23321" name=
"xd26e23321src">26</a>. Here one is tempted to perpetrate a little
glottologic alchemy <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb677" href=
"#v2pb677" name="v2pb677">677</a>]</span>by changing <i>l</i> into
<i>n</i>, and to suppose <i>Iclingas</i> the form taken in English by
the name of the ancient people of the <i>Iceni</i>. In any case,
nothing could be more reasonable to suppose than that some
representatives of the royal race of Prasutagus and Boudicca, escaping
the sword of the Roman, found refuge among the Coritanians at the time
of the final defeat of their own people: it is even possible that they
were already the ruling family there. At all events several indications
converge to show that communities speaking Brythonic were not far off,
to wit, the <i>p</i> names in the Mercian genealogy, Guthlac&rsquo;s
father&rsquo;s surname, Guthlac&rsquo;s exile among Brythons, and the
attack on him at Croyland by Brythonic speaking foes. Portions of the
Coritanian territory were eminently fitted by nature to serve as a
refuge for a broken people with a belated language: witness as late as
the eleventh century the stand made in the Isle of Ely by Hereward
against the Norman conqueror and his mail-clad knights<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e23362src" href="#xd26e23362" name=
"xd26e23362src">27</a>.</p>
<p>Among the speakers of Goidelic in Ireland and the Highlands of
Scotland the fairies take their designation chiefly from a word
<i>s&iacute;d</i> or <i>s&iacute;th</i> (genitive <i>s&iacute;de</i> or
<i>s&iacute;da</i>), which one may possibly consider as of a common
origin with the Latin word <i>s&#275;des</i>, and as originally meaning
a seat or settlement, but it sooner or later came to signify simply an
abode of the fairies, whence they were called in Medieval Irish <i>aes

imprisonments, including that of Arthur in Caer Oeth and Anoeth (p.

It is not improbable that the legend about Gwair located his prison on
Lundy, as the Welsh name of that island appears to have been <i>Ynys
Wair</i>, &lsquo;Gwair&rsquo;s Isle.&rsquo; Pwy&#7931; and Pryderi did
not belong to Annwn, nor did Pryderi&rsquo;s friend Manawy&#273;an; but
the <i>Mabinogi</i> of Pwy&#7931; relates how for a whole year
Pwy&#7931; exchanged crown and kingdom with Arawn king of Annwn, from
whom he obtained the first breed of domestic pigs for his own people
(pp. 69, 525).</p>
<p>In the lowlands of Scotland, together with the Orkneys and
Shetlands, the Picts have to a certain extent taken the place of our
fairies, and they are colloquially called Pechts. Now judging from the
remains there ascribed to the Pechts, their habitations were either
wholly underground or else so covered over with stones and earth and
grass as to look like natural hillocks and to avoid attracting the
attention of strangers. This was helped by making the entrance very low
and as inconspicuous as possible. But one of the most remarkable things
about these <i>s&iacute;ds</i> is that the cells within them are
frequently <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb680" href="#v2pb680" name=
"v2pb680">680</a>]</span>so small as to prove beyond doubt, that those
who inhabited them were of a remarkably short stature, though it is
demonstrated by the weight of the stones used, that the builders were
not at all lacking in bodily strength<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e23566src" href="#xd26e23566" name="xd26e23566src">31</a>. Here we
have, accordingly, a small people like our own fairies. In Ireland one
of the most famous kings of the fairies was called Mider of Br&iacute;
L&eacute;ith, where he resided in a <i>s&iacute;d</i> or mound in the
neighbourhood of Ardagh, in the county of Longford; and thither Irish
legend represents him carrying away &Eacute;tain, queen of Eochaid
Airem, king of Ireland during a part of Conchobar MacNessa&rsquo;s
time. Now Eochaid was for a whole year unable to find where she was,
but his druid, Dal&aacute;n, wrote Ogams and at last found it out.
Eochaid then marched to Br&iacute; L&eacute;ith, and began to demolish
Mider&rsquo;s <i>s&iacute;d</i>, whereupon Mider was eventually so
frightened that he sent forth the queen to her husband, who then went
his way, leaving the mound folk to digest their wrath. For it is
characteristic of them that they did not fight, but chose to bide their
time for revenge. In this instance it did not arrive till long after
Eochaid&rsquo;s day<a class="noteref" id="xd26e23585src" href=
"#xd26e23585" name="xd26e23585src">32</a>. I may add that &Eacute;tain
was herself one of the <i>s&iacute;de</i> or fairies; and one of
Mider&rsquo;s reasons for taking her away was, that she had been his
wife in a previous stage of existence. Now it is true that the fairy
Mider is described as resembling the other heroes of Irish story, in
having golden yellow hair and bright <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb681" href="#v2pb681" name="v2pb681">681</a>]</span>blue
eyes<a class="noteref" id="xd26e23593src" href="#xd26e23593" name=
"xd26e23593src">33</a>, but he differs completely from them in being no
warrior but a great wizard; and though he is not said to have been of
small stature, the dwarfs were not far off. For in describing the poet
Atherne, who was notorious for his stinginess (p. 635), the
story-teller emphasizes his words by representing him taking from Mider
three of his dwarfs and stationing them around his own house, in order
that their truculent looks and rude words might drive away anybody who
came to seek hospitality or to present an unwelcome request<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e23602src" href="#xd26e23602" name=
"xd26e23602src">34</a>, a r&ocirc;le which recalls that of Edern ab
Nu&#273;&rsquo;s dwarf already mentioned (p. 672). Here the Irish word
used is <i>corr</i>, which is probably to be identified with the
Brythonic <i>cor</i>, &lsquo;a dwarf,&rsquo; though the better known
meaning of <i>corr</i> in Irish is &lsquo;crane or heron.&rsquo; From
the former also is hardly to be severed the Irish <i>corrguinigh</i>,
&lsquo;sorcerers,&rsquo; and <i>corrguinacht</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e23626src" href="#xd26e23626" name="xd26e23626src">35</a>, or the
process of cursing to which the <i>corrguinigh</i> resorted, as, for
instance, when N&eacute;de called forth the fatal blisters on
Caier&rsquo;s face (p. 632). The r&ocirc;le would seem exactly to suit
the little people, who were consummate magicians.</p>
<p>Let me for a moment leave the little people, in order to call
attention to another side of this question of race. It has recently
been shown<a class="noteref" id="xd26e23658src" href="#xd26e23658"
name="xd26e23658src">36</a> by Professor J. Morris Jones, of the
University College of North Wales, that the non-Aryan traits of the
syntax of our insular Celtic point unmistakably to that of old Egyptian
and Berber, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb682" href="#v2pb682"
name="v2pb682">682</a>]</span>together with kindred idioms belonging to
the southern shore of the Mediterranean Sea. He has thereby reduced to
articulate speech, so to say, the physiognomical convictions of
Professor Sayce (p. 665), to which the reader&rsquo;s attention has
been called. To the linguistic argument he appends a statement cited
from a French authority and bearing on the question of descent by
birth, to the effect, that when among the Berbers the king dies or is
deposed, as happens often enough, it is not his son that is called to
succeed, but the son of his sister, as in the case of the historical
Picts of Scotland down to the twelfth century or thereabouts. Here I
would add, that my attention has been called by Professor Sayce to old
Egyptian monuments representing the Libyan chiefs with their bodies
tattooed, a habit which seems not to be yet extinct among the Touaregs
and Kabyles<a class="noteref" id="xd26e23666src" href="#xd26e23666"
name="xd26e23666src">37</a>. Lastly, Mr. Nicholson has recently
directed attention to the fact that some princes of ancient Gaul are
represented with their faces tattooed on certain coins found in the
west of France so far south as the region once occupied by the ancient
Pictones. We have a compendious commentary on this in the occurrence of
a word <i>Chortonicum</i> in a High German manuscript written before
the year 814: I allude to the Wessobrunn Codex at Munich, in which,
among a number of geographical names connected with Gaul and other
countries, that vocable is so placed as to allow of our referring it to
Poitou or to all Gaul as the country once of the ancient Pictones. The
great German philologist Pott, who called attention to it, brought it
at once into relation with <i>Cruithne</i>, plural <i>Cruithni</i>,
&lsquo;the Picts of Britain and Ireland,&rsquo; a word which has been
explained at p. 281 above<a class="noteref" id="xd26e23685src" href=
"#xd26e23685" name="xd26e23685src">38</a>. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb683" href="#v2pb683" name=
"v2pb683">683</a>]</span></p>
<p>Now at last I come to the question, what pre-Celtic race or races
make themselves evident in the mass of things touched on in this and
the foregoing chapters? The answer must, I think, recognize at least
two. First comes the race of the mound folk, consisting of the short
swarthy people variously caricatured in our fairy tales. They formed
isolated fractions of a widely spread race possessed of no political
significance whatsoever; but, with the inconsistency ever clinging to
everything connected with the fairies, the weird and uncanny folk
emerging from its underground lairs seems to have exercised on other
races a sort of permanent spell of mysteriousness amounting to
adoration. In fact, Irish literature tells us that the
<i>s&iacute;de</i> were worshipped (p. 678). Owing to his faculty of
exaggeration, combined with his inability to comprehend the little
people, the Celt was enabled to bequeath to the great literatures of
Western Europe a motley train of dwarfs and brownies, a whole world of
wizardry and magic. The real race of the little people forms the lowest
stratum which we can reach, to wit, at a level no higher, seemingly,
than that of the present-day natives of Central Australia. Thus some of
the birth stories of C&uacute;chulainn and &Eacute;t&aacute;in seem to
have passed through their hands, and they bear a striking resemblance
to certain notions of the Lapps (pp. 657&ndash;8). In fact, the nature
of the habitations of our little people, together with other points
which might be mentioned, would seem at first sight to betoken affinity
with the Lapps; but I am warned by experts<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e23715src" href="#xd26e23715" name="xd26e23715src">39</a> that
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb684" href="#v2pb684" name=
"v2pb684">684</a>]</span>there are serious craniological difficulties
in the way of any racial comparison with the Lapps, and that one must
look rather to the dwarf populations once widely spread over our
hemisphere, and still to be found here and there in Europe, as, for
example, in Sicily. To come nearer our British Isles, the presence of
such dwarfs has been established with regard to Switzerland in
neolithic times<a class="noteref" id="xd26e23725src" href="#xd26e23725"
name="xd26e23725src">40</a>.</p>
<p>The other race may be called Picts, which is probably the earliest
of the names given it by the Celts; and their affinities appear to be
Libyan, possibly Iberian. It was a warlike stock, and stood higher
altogether than the mound inhabitants; for it had a notion of
paternity, though, on account of its promiscuity, it had to reckon
descent by birth (pp. 654&ndash;6). To it probably belonged all the
great family groups figuring in the <i>Mabinogion</i> and the
corresponding class of literature in Irish: this would include the
Danann-D&ocirc;n group and the Lir-&#7930;yr group, together with the
families represented by Pwy&#7931; and Rhiannon, who were inseparable
from the &#7930;yr group in Welsh, just as the Lir group was
inseparable from the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb685" href=
"#v2pb685" name="v2pb685">685</a>]</span>Tuatha D&eacute; Danann in
Irish legend (pp. 548&ndash;9). The Picts made slaves and drudges of
the mound-haunting race, but how far any amalgamation may have taken
place between them it is impossible to say. Even without any
amalgamation, however, the little people, if employed as nurses to
their Pictish lords&rsquo; children, could not help leaving their
impress in time on the language of the ruling nationality. But it may
be that the treatment of the Picts, by Scottish legend, as a kind of
fairies really points to amalgamation, though it is not impossible that
arch&aelig;ology may be able to classify the remains of the dwellings
ascribed to the Pechts, that is, to assign a certain class to the
warlike Picts of history and another to the dwarf race of the
<i>s&iacute;ds</i>. A certain measure of amalgamation may also be the
meaning of the Irish tradition, that when the Milesian Irish came and
conquered, the defeated Tuatha D&eacute; Danann gave up their life
above ground and retired inside the hills like the fairies. This
account of them may be as worthless as the story of the extermination
of the Picts of Scotland: both peoples doubtless lived on to amalgamate
in time with the conquering race; but it may mean that some of them
retreated before the Celts, and concealed themselves after the manner
of the little people&mdash;in underground dwellings in the less
accessible parts of the country. In any case, it may well be that they
got their magic and druidism from the dwellers of the
<i>s&iacute;ds</i>. In the next place, it has been pointed out (pp.
550&ndash;1) how the adjective <i>h&ecirc;n</i>, &lsquo;old,
ancient,&rsquo; is applied in Welsh to several of the chief men of the
D&ocirc;n group, and by this one may probably understand that they were
old not merely to those who told the stories about them in Welsh, but
to those who put those stories together in Goidelic ages earlier. The
geography of the <i>Mabinogion</i> gives the prehistoric remains
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb686" href="#v2pb686" name=
"v2pb686">686</a>]</span>of Penmaen Mawr and Tre&rsquo;r Ceiri to the
D&ocirc;n group; but by its name, <i>Tre&rsquo;r Ceiri</i> should be
the &lsquo;Town of the Keiri,&rsquo; a word probably referring to the
Picts (pp. 279&ndash;83): this, so far as it goes, makes the sons of
D&ocirc;n belong by race to the Picts. Lastly, it is the widely spread
race of the Picts, conquered by the Celts of the Celtican or Goidelic
branch and amalgamating with their conquerors in the course of time,
that has left its non-Aryan impress on the syntax of the Celtic
languages of the British Isles.</p>
<p>These, it is needless to say, are conjectures which I cannot
establish; but possibly somebody else may. For the present, however,
they cannot fail to suggest a moral, habitually ignored with a light
heart by most people&mdash;including the writer of these
words&mdash;that men in his plight, men engaged in studies which, owing
to a rapid accumulation of fresh facts or the blossoming of new
theories, are in a shifting condition, should abstain from producing
books or anything longer than a magazine article now and then. Even
such minor productions should be understood to be liable to be cast
into a great bonfire lit once a year, say on Halloween. This should
help to clear the air of mistaken hypotheses, whether of folklore and
myth or of history and language, and also serve to mark <i lang=
"cy">Nos <span class="corr" id="xd26e23760" title=
"Source: Galangaeaf">Calangaeaf</span></i> as the commencement of the
ancient Celtic year. The business of selecting the papers to be saved
from the burning might be delegated to an academy constituted, roughly
speaking, on the lines of Plato&rsquo;s aristocracy of intellect. Such
academy, once in the enjoyment of its existence, would also find plenty
of work in addition to the inquisitional business which I have
suggested: it should, for example, be invested with summary
jurisdiction over fond parents who venture to show any unreasonable
anxiety to save their mental progeny from the annual <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb687" href="#v2pb687" name=
"v2pb687">687</a>]</span>bonfire. The best of that class of writers
should be ordered by the academy to sing songs or indite original
verse. As for the rest, some of them might be told off to gesticulate
to the gallery, and some to administer the consolations of platitude to
stragglers tired of the march of science. There is a mass of other
useful work which would naturally devolve on an academy of the kind
here suggested. I should be happy, if space permitted, to go through
the particulars one by one, but let a single instance suffice: the
academy might relieve us of the painful necessity of having seriously
to consider any further the proposal that professors found professing
after sixty should be shot. This will serve to indicate the kind of
work which might advantageously be entrusted to the august body which
is here but roughly projected.</p>
<p>There are some branches of learning in the happy position of having
no occasion for such a body academical. Thus, if a man will have it
that the earth is flat, as flat in fact as some people do their utmost
to make it, &lsquo;he will most likely,&rsquo; as the late Mr. Freeman
in the <i>Saturday Review</i> once put it, &lsquo;make few converts,
and will be forgotten after at most a passing laugh from scientific
men.&rsquo; If a man insists that the sum of two and two is five, he
will probably find his way to a lunatic asylum, as the economy of
society is, in a manner, self-acting. So with regard to him who carries
his craze into the more material departments of such a science as
chemistry: he may be expected to blow out his own eyes, for the
almighty molecule executes its own vengeance. &lsquo;But,&rsquo; to
quote again from Mr. Freeman, if that man&rsquo;s &lsquo;craze had been
historical or philological&rsquo;&mdash;and above all if it had to do
with the science of man or of myth&mdash;&lsquo;he might have put forth
notions quite as absurd as the notion that the earth is flat, and many
people would not have been <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb688" href=
"#v2pb688" name="v2pb688">688</a>]</span>in the least able to see that
they were absurd. If any scholar had tried to confute him we should
have heard of &ldquo;controversies&rdquo; and &ldquo;differences of
opinion.&rdquo;&#8202;&rsquo; In fact, the worst that happens to the
false prophet who shines in any such a science is, that he has usually
only too many enthusiastic followers. The machinery is, so to say, not
automatic, and hence it is that we want the help of an academy. But
even supposing such an academy established, no one need feel alarmed
lest opportunities enough could no longer be found for cultivating the
example of those of the early Christians who had the rare grace to
suffer fools gladly.</p>
<p>Personally, however, I should be against doing anything in a hurry;
and, considering how little his fellows dare expect from the man who is
just waiting to be final and perfect before he commit himself to type,
the establishment of an academy invested with the summary powers which
have been briefly sketched might, perhaps, after all, conveniently wait
a while: my own feeling is that almost any time, say in the latter half
of the twentieth century, would do better than this year or the next.
In the meantime one must be content to entrust the fortunes of our
studies to the combined forces of science and common sense. Judging by
what they have achieved in recent years, there is no reason to be
uneasy with regard to the time to come, for it is as true to-day as
when it was first written, that the best of the prophets of the Future
is the Past. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb689" href="#v2pb689"

has, however, to admit that the same agency may also mar the picture.
Since the above was written I have read in Stokes&rsquo; <i lang=
"de">Festschrift</i>, pp. 7&ndash;19, a very interesting article by L.
Chr. Stern, in which he discusses some of the difficulties attaching to
the term <i>Tuatha D&eacute; Danann</i>. Among other things he suggests
that there was a certain amount of confusion between <i>Danann</i> and
<i>d&aacute;na</i>, genitive of <i>d&aacute;n</i>, &lsquo;art or
profession&rsquo;&mdash;the word <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb646n" href="#v2pb646n" name="v2pb646n">646</a>]</span>meant also
&lsquo;lot or destiny,&rsquo; being probably of the same origin as the
Latin <i lang="la">donum</i>, in Welsh <i lang="cy">dawn</i>, which
means a gift, and especially &lsquo;the gift of the gab.&rsquo; But it
would invert the natural sequence to suppose any such a formula as
<i>Tuatha D&eacute; D&aacute;na</i> to have preceded <i>Tuatha
D&eacute; Danann</i>; for why should anybody substitute an obscure
vocable <i>Danann</i> for <i>d&aacute;na</i> of well-known meaning? Dr.
Stern has some doubts as to the Welsh D&ocirc;n being a female; but it
would have been more satisfactory if he had proved his surmise, or at
any rate shown that <i>D&ocirc;n</i> has nothing to do with
<i>Danann</i> or <i>Donann</i>. I am satisfied with such a passage in
the <i>Mabinogi</i> of Math as that where Gwydion, addressing Math,
describes Arianrhod, daughter of D&ocirc;n, in the words, <i>dy nith
uerch dy ch&#7933;aer</i>, &lsquo;thy niece daughter of thy
sister&rsquo;: see the <i>Mabinogion</i>, p. 68, and, for similar
references to other children of D&ocirc;n, consult pp. 59 and 65.
Arianrhod is in the older Triads, i. 40, ii. 15, called daughter of
Beli, whom one can only have regarded as her father. So for the present
I continue to accept Stokes&rsquo; rendering of <i>Tuatha D&eacute;
Danann</i> as &lsquo;the Folks of the Goddess

versions of a story to account for the Ultonian couvade have been
published with a translation into German, by Prof. Windisch, in the
<i lang="de">Berichte der k. s&auml;chs. Gesellschaft der

338 et seq. Sundry references to the couvade will also be found in my
<i>Hibbert Lectures</i>, where certain mythological suggestions made
with reference to it require to be reconsidered. But when touching on
this point it occurred to me that the wholesale couvade of the Ultonian
braves, at one and the same time of the year, implied that the birth of
Ultonian children, or at any rate those of them that were to be reared,
took place (in some period or other of the history of their race) at a
particular season of the year, namely, about the beginning of the
winter, that is when food would be most abundant. I have since been
confirmed in this view by perusing Westermarck&rsquo;s work on the
<i>History of Human Marriage</i>, and by reading especially his second
chapter entitled &lsquo;A Human Pairing Season in Primitive
Times.&rsquo; For there I find a considerable body of instances in
point, together with a summary treatment of the whole question. But in
the case of promiscuity, such as originally prevailed doubtless at the
Ultonian Court, the question what men were to go into couvade could
only be settled by the confinement of them all, wherein we have an
alternative if not an additional reason for a simultaneous
couvade.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd26e22703src">&uarr;</a></p>

not the direct result of intercourse, that it may come without this,
which merely, as it were, prepares the mother for the reception and
birth also of an already-formed spirit child who inhabits one of the
local totem centres. Time after time we have questioned them on this
point, and always received the reply that the child was not the direct
result of intercourse.&rsquo; It is curious to note how readily the

difference between Mod. Welsh <i>cor</i> and Breton <i>korr</i> is one
of spelling, for the reformed orthography of Welsh words only doubles
the <i>r</i> where it is dwelt on in the accented syllable of a longer
word: in other terms, when that syllable closes with the consonant and
the next syllable begins with it. Thus <i>cor</i> has, as its
derivatives, <i>c&oacute;r-rach</i>, &lsquo;a dwarf,&rsquo; plural
<i>co-r&aacute;chod</i>, <i>c&oacute;r-ryn</i>, &lsquo;a male
dwarf,&rsquo; plural <i>co-r&yacute;nnod</i>. Some of these enter into
place-names, such as <i>Cwm Corryn</i> near &#7930;anaelhaearn (p.
217<span class="corr" id="xd26e23132" title="Not in source">)</span>
and <i>Cwm Corryn</i> draining into the Vale of Neath; so possibly with
<i>Corwen</i> for <i>Cor-waen</i>, in the sense of &lsquo;the
Fairies&rsquo; Meadow.&rsquo; <i>Cor</i> and <i>corryn</i> are also
used for the spider, as in <i>gwe&rsquo;r cor</i> or <i>gwe&rsquo;r
corryn</i>, &lsquo;a spider&rsquo;s web,&rsquo; the spider being so
called on account of its spinning, an occupation in which the fairies
are represented likewise frequently engaged; not to mention that
gossamer (<i>gwawn</i>) is also sometimes regarded as a product of the
fairy loom (p. 103). The derivation of <i>cor</i> is not satisfactorily
cleared up: it has been conjectured to be related to a Med. Irish word
<i>cert</i>, &lsquo;small, little,&rsquo; and Latin <i>curtus</i>,
&lsquo;shortened or mutilated.&rsquo; To me this means that the origin
of the word still remains to be discovered.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow"

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb684n" href="#v2pb684n" name=

my theory as to the origins of the fairies: witness the following
extract from the syllabus of a lecture delivered by him at Cardiff in
1894 on <i>Fairy Tales</i>:&mdash;&lsquo;What are the
fairies?&mdash;Legendary origin of the fairies. It is evident from
fairy literature that there is a mixture of the possible and the
impossible, of fact and fancy. Part of fairydom refers to (1) spirits
that never were embodied: other fairies are (2) spirits of environment,
nature or local spirits, and household or domestic spirits; (3) spirits
of the organic world, spirits of plants, and spirits of animals; (4)
spirits of men or ghosts; and (5) witches and wizards, or men possessed
with other spirits. All these and possibly other elements enter into
the fanciful aspect of fairyland, but there is a large residuum of real
occurrences; these point to a clash of races, and we may regard many of
these fairy sagas as stories told by men of the Iron Age of events
which happened to men of the Bronze Age in their conflicts with men of
the Neolithic Age, and possibly these, too, handed on traditions of the
Pal&aelig;olithic Age.&rsquo;&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

<p class="first">P. <a href="#v1pb81" class="pageref">81</a>. I learn
that the plural of <i>bodach glas</i> was in Welsh <i>bodachod
gleision</i>, a term which Elis o&rsquo;r Nant remembers his mother
applying to a kind of fairies dressed in blue and fond of leading
people astray. She used to relate how a haymaking party once passed a
summer&rsquo;s night at the cowhouse (<i>beudy</i>) of Bryn
Bygely&#273; (also <i>Bryn Mygely&#273;</i>), and how they saw in the
dead of night a host of these dwarfs (<i>corynnod</i>) in blue dancing
and capering about the place. The <i>beudy</i> in question is not very
far from Dolwy&#273;elan, on the way to Capel Curig. A different
picture of the <i>bodach</i> is given in Jenkins&rsquo; <i>Be&#273;
Gelert</i>, p. 82; and lastly one may contrast the Highland <i>Bodach
Glas</i> mentioned at p. 520 above, not to mention still another kind,
namely the one in Scott&rsquo;s <i>Waverley</i>.</p>
<p>P. <a href="#v1pb130" class="pageref">130</a>. To <i>Sarn yr
Afanc</i> add <i>&#7930;yn yr Afanc</i>, near &#7930;an&#273;inam
(<i>Beauties of Wales</i>, N. Wales, p. 841), and <i>Be&#273; yr
Afanc</i>, &lsquo;the Afanc&rsquo;s Grave,&rsquo; the name of some sort
of a tumulus, I am told, on a knoll near the Pembrokeshire stream of
the Nevern. Mr. J. Thomas, of Bancau Bryn Berian close by, has
communicated to me certain echoes of a story how an afanc was caught in
a pool near the bridge of Bryn Berian, and how it was taken up to be
interred in what is now regarded as its grave. A complete list of the
afanc place-names in the Principality might possibly prove instructive.
As to the word <i>afanc</i>, what seems to have happened is this: (1)
from meaning simply a dwarf it came to be associated with such water
dwarfs as those mentioned at p. 432; (2) the meaning being forgotten,
the word was applied to any water monster; and (3) where <i>afanc</i>
occurs in place-names the Hu story has been introduced to explain it,
whether it fitted or not. This I should fancy to be the case with the
Bryn Berian barrow, and it would be satisfactory to know whether it
contains the remains of an ordinary dwarf. Peredur&rsquo;s lake afanc
may have been a dwarf; but whether that was so or not, it is remarkable
that the weapon which the afanc handled was a <i>&#7931;echwaew</i> or
flake-spear, that is, a missile tipped with stone.</p>
<p>P. <a href="#v1pb131" class="pageref">131</a>. With the r&ocirc;le
of the girl in the afanc story compare that of Tegau, wife of Caradog
Freichfras, on whom a serpent fastens and can only be allured away to
seize on one of Tegau&rsquo;s breasts, of which she loses the nipple
when the beast is cut off. The defect being replaced with gold, she is
ever after known as <i>Tegau Eur-fron</i>, or &lsquo;Tegau of the
golden Breast.&rsquo; That is a version inferred of a story which is
discussed by M. Gaston Paris in an article, on <i>Caradoc et le
Serpent</i>, elicited by a paper published (in the November number of
<i>Modern Language Notes</i> for 1898) by Miss C. A. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb690" href="#v2pb690" name=
"v2pb690">690</a>]</span>Harper, of Bryn Mawr College, U.S.: see the
<i>Romania</i>, xxviii. 214&ndash;31. One of Miss Harper&rsquo;s
parallels, mentioned by M. Paris at p. 220, comes from Campbell: it is
concerning a prince who receives from his stepmother a magic shirt
which converts itself into a serpent coiled round his neck, and of
which he is rid by the help of a woman acting in much the same way as
Tegau. We have an echo of this in the pedigrees in the Jesus College
MS. 20: see the <i>Cymmrodor</i>, viii. 88, where one reads of <i lang=
"cy">G&#7933;ga&#7933;n keneu menrud a vu neidyr vl&#7933;ydyn am y
von&#7933;gyl</i>, &lsquo;Gwgon the whelp of <i>Menrud</i> (?) who was
a year with a snake round his neck&rsquo;&mdash;his pedigree is also
given. In M. Paris&rsquo; suggested reconstruction of the story (p.
228) from the different versions, he represents the maiden who is to
induce the serpent to leave the man on whom it has fastened, as
standing in a vessel filled with milk, while the man stands in a vessel
filled with vinegar. The heroine exposes herself to the reptile, which
relinquishes his present victim to seize on one of the woman&rsquo;s
breasts. Now the appropriateness of the milk is explained by the belief
that snakes are inordinately fond of milk, and that belief has, I
presume, a foundation in fact: at any rate I am reminded of its
introduction into the plot of more than one English story, such as
Stanley Weyman&rsquo;s book <i>From the Memoirs of a Minister of
France</i> (London, 1895), p. 445, and A. Conan Doyle&rsquo;s
<i>Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</i> (London, 1893), pp. 199&ndash;209.
In Wales, however, it is to a woman&rsquo;s milk that one&rsquo;s
interest attaches: I submit two references which will explain what I
mean. The first of them is to Owen&rsquo;s <i>Welsh Folk-Lore</i>, p.
349, where he says that &lsquo;traditions of flying snakes were once
common in all parts of Wales,&rsquo; and adds as
follows:&mdash;&lsquo;The traditional origin of these imaginary
creatures was that they were snakes, which by having drunk the milk of
a woman, and by having eaten of bread consecrated for the Holy
Communion, became transformed into winged serpents or dragons.&rsquo;
The other is to the <i>Brython</i> for 1861, p. 190, where one reads in
Welsh to the following effect:&mdash;&lsquo;If a snake chances to have
an opportunity to drink of a woman&rsquo;s milk it is certain to become
a <i>gwiber</i>. When a woman happens to be far from her child, and her
breasts are full and beginning to give her pain, she sometimes milks
them on the ground in order to ease them. To this the peasantry in
parts of Cardiganshire have a strong objection, lest a snake should
come there and drink the milk, and so become a <i>gwiber</i>.&rsquo;
The word <i>gwiber</i> is used in the Welsh Bible for a viper, but the
editor of the <i>Brython</i> explains, that in our folklore it means a
huge kind of snake or dragon that has grown wings and has its body
cased in hard scales: for a noted instance in point he refers the
reader to the first number of the <i>Brython</i>, p. 3. It is believed
still all over Wales that snakes may, under favourable circumstances,
develop wings: in fact, an Anglesey man strongly wished, to my
knowledge, to offer to the recent Welsh Land Commission, as evidence of
the wild and neglected state of a certain farm, that the gorse had
grown so high and the snakes so thriven in it that he had actually seen
one of the latter flying right across a wide road which separated two
such gorse forests as he described: surprised and hurt to find that
this was not accepted, he inferred that the Commissioners knew next to
nothing about their business.</p>
<p>Pp. <a href="#v1pb148" class="pageref">148</a>, <a href="#v1pb170"
class="pageref">170</a>. With &lsquo;the spell of security&rsquo; by
catching hold of grass may perhaps be compared a habit which boys in
Cardiganshire have of suddenly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb691"
href="#v2pb691" name="v2pb691">691</a>]</span>picking up a blade of
grass when they want a truce or stoppage in a sort of game of tig or
touchwood. The grass gives the one who avails himself of it immunity
for a time from attack or pursuit, so as to allow him to begin the game
again just where it was left off.</p>
<p>P. <a href="#v1pb228" class="pageref">228</a>. <i>Bodermud</i> would
probably be more correctly written <i>Bodermyd</i>, and analysed
possibly into <i>Bod-&#272;ermyd</i>, involving the name which appears
in Irish as <i>Diarmait</i> and <i>Dermot</i>.</p>
<p>P. <a href="#v1pb230" class="pageref">230</a>. Since this was
printed I have been assured by Mr. Thomas Prichard of &#7930;wydiarth
Esgob, in Anglesey, that the <i>dolur byr</i> is more commonly called
<i>clwy&rsquo; byr</i>, and that it is the disease known in English as
&lsquo;black quarter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Pp. <a href="#v1pb259" class="pageref">259</a>, <a href="#v1pb268"
class="pageref">268</a>. I am assured on the part of several literary
natives of Glamorgan that they do not know <i>d&acirc;r</i> for
<i>daear</i>, &lsquo;ground, earth.&rsquo; Such negative evidence,
though proving the literary form <i>daear</i> to prevail now, is not to
be opposed to the positive statement, sent by Mr. Hughes (p. 173) to
me, as to the persistence in his neighbourhood of <i>d&acirc;r</i> and
<i>cl&acirc;r</i> (for <i>claear</i>, &lsquo;lukewarm&rsquo;), to which
one may add, as unlikely to be challenged by anybody, the case of
<i>h&#259;rn</i> for <i>haearn</i>, &lsquo;iron.&rsquo; The
intermediate forms have to be represented as <i>daer</i>, <i>claer</i>,
and <i>haern</i>, which explain exactly the <i>gaem</i> of the <i>Book
of St. Chad</i>, for which modern literary Welsh has <i>gaeaf</i>,
&lsquo;winter&rsquo;: see the preface to the <i>Book of &#7930;an
D&acirc;v</i>, p. xlv.</p>
<p>P. <a href="#v1pb290" class="pageref">290</a>. It ought to have been
pointed out that the fairies, whose food and drink it is death to
share, represent the dead.</p>
<p>P. <a href="#v1pb291" class="pageref">291</a>. For <i>Conla</i> read
<i>Connla</i> or <i>Condla</i>: the later form is <i>Colla</i>. The
Condla in question is called <i>Condla R&uacute;ad</i> in the story,
but the heading to it has <i>Ectra Condla Chaim</i>, &lsquo;the
Adventure of C. the Dear One.&rsquo;</p>
<p>P. <a href="#v1pb294" class="pageref">294</a>. I am now inclined to
think that <i>butch</i> was produced out of the northern pronunciation
of <i>witch</i> by regarding its <i>w</i> as a mutation consonant and
replacing it, as in some other instances, by <i>b</i> as the
radical.</p>
<p>P. <a href="#v1pb308" class="pageref">308</a>. With the Manx use of
rowan on May-day compare a passage to the following effect concerning
Wales&mdash;I translate it from the faulty Welsh in which it is quoted
by one of the competitors for the folklore prize at the Liverpool
Eiste&#273;fod, 1900: he gave no indication of its
provenance:&mdash;Another bad papistic habit which prevails among some
Welsh people is that of placing some of the wood of the rowan tree
(<i>coed cer&#273;in</i> or <i>criafol</i>) in their corn lands
(<i>&#7931;afyrieu</i>) and their fields on May-eve (<i>Nos Glamau</i>)
with the idea that such a custom brings a blessing on their fields, a
proceeding which would better become atheists and pagans than
Christians.</p>
<p>P. <a href="#v1pb325" class="pageref">325</a>. In the comparison
with the brownie the fairy nurse in the Pennant Valley has been
overlooked: see p. 109.</p>

fairy wells, also with the wells which have been more especially called
sacred in this volume, compare the following paragraph from
Martin&rsquo;s <i>Description of the Western Islands of Scotland</i>
(London, 1703), pp. 229&ndash;30: it is concerning <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb692" href="#v2pb692" name=
"v2pb692">692</a>]</span>Gigay, now more commonly written <i>Gigha</i>,
the name of an island near the west coast of
Kintyre:&mdash;&lsquo;There is a well in the north end of this isle
called Toubir-more, i. e. a great well, because of its effects, for
which it is famous among the islanders; who together with the
inhabitants use it as a <i>Catholicon</i> for diseases. It&rsquo;s
covered with stone and clay, because the natives fancy that the stream
that flows from it might overflow the isle; and it is always opened by
a <i>Diroch</i>, i. e. an inmate, else they think it would not exert
its vertues. They ascribe one very extraordinary effect to it, and
&rsquo;tis this; that when any foreign boats are wind-bound here (which
often happens) the master of the boat ordinarily gives the native that
lets the water run a piece of money, and they say that immediately
afterwards the wind changes in favour of those that are thus
detain&rsquo;d by contrary winds. Every stranger that goes to drink of
the water of this well, is accustomed to leave on its stone cover a
piece of money, a needle, pin, or one of the prettiest <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e24095" title="Source: varieated">variegated</span>
stones they can find.&rsquo; Last September I visited Gigha and saw a
well there which is supposed to be the one to which Martin refers. It
is very insignificant and known now by a name pronounced <i lang=
"ga">Tobar a ve&#775;ac</i>, possibly for an older <i>Mo-Bheac</i>: in
Scotch Gaelic <i>B&euml;ac</i>, written <i>Beathag</i>, is equated with
the name Sophia. The only tradition now current about the well is that
emptying it used to prove the means of raising a wind or even of
producing great storms, and this appears to have been told Pennant: see
his <i>Tour in Scotland and Voyage to the Hebrides, MDCCLXXII</i>
(Chester, 1774), p. 226:&mdash;&lsquo;Visit the few wonders of the
isle: the first is a little well of a most miraculous quality, for in
old times, if ever the chieftain lay here wind-bound, he had nothing
more to do than cause the well to be cleared, and instantly a favorable
gale arose. But miracles are now ceased.&rsquo;</p>
<p>P. <a href="#v1pb378" class="pageref">378</a>. A similar rhyme is
current in the neighbourhood of Dolge&#7931;ey, as Miss Lucy Griffith
informs me, as follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">

<p class="first">P. <a href="#v1pb394" class="pageref">394</a>. With
regard to wells killing women visiting them, I may mention a story,
told me the other day by Professor Mahaffy after a friend whose name he
gave, concerning the inhabitants of one of the small islands on the
coast of Mayo&mdash;I understood him to say off the Mullet. It was
this: all the men and boys, having gone fishing, were prevented by
rough weather from returning as soon as they intended, and the women
left alone suffered greatly from want of water, as not one of them
would venture to go to the well. By-and-by, however, one of them gave
birth to a boy, whereupon another of them carried the baby to the well,
and ventured to draw water.</p>
<p>P. <a href="#v2pb418" class="pageref">418</a>. As to <i>Clychau
Aberdyfi</i> I am now convinced that the <i>chwech</i> and <i>saith</i>
are entirely due to the published versions, the editors of which seem
to have agreed that they will have as much as possible for their money,
so to say. I find that Mrs. Rhys learnt in her childhood to end the
words with <i>pump</i>, and that she cannot now be brought to sing the
melody in any other way: I have similar testimony from a musical lady
from the neighbourhood of Wrexham; and, doubtless, more evidence of the
same sort could be got.</p>

<p>Pp. <a href="#v2pb450" class="pageref">450</a>&ndash;1. Some
additional light on the doggerel dialogue will be found thrown by the
following story, which I find cited in Welsh by one of the Liverpool
Eiste&#273;fod competitors:&mdash;There is in the parish of Yspytty
Ifan, in Carnarvonshire, a farm called Trwyn Swch, where eighty years
ago lived a man and his wife, who were both young, and had twins born
to them. Now the mother went one day to milk, leaving the twins alone
in the cradle&mdash;the husband was not at home&mdash;and who should
enter the house but one of the <i>Tylwyth Teg</i>! He took the twins
away and left two of his own breed in the cradle in their stead.
Thereupon the mother returned home and saw what had come to pass; she
then in her excitement snatched the <i>Tylwyth Teg</i> twins and took
them to the bridge that crosses the huge gorge of the river Conwy not
very far from the house, and she cast them into the whirlpool below. By
this time the <i>Tylwyth Teg</i> had come on the spot, some trying to
save the children, and some making for the woman. &lsquo;Seize the old
hag!&rsquo; (<i>Crap ar yr hen wrach!</i>) said one of the chiefs of
the <i>Tylwyth Teg</i>. &lsquo;Too late!&rsquo; cried the woman on the
edge of the bank; and many of them ran after her to the house. As they
ran three or four of them lost their pipes in the field. They are pipes
ingeniously made of the blue stone (<i>carreg las</i>) of the gully.
They measure three or four inches long, and from time to time several
of them have been found near the cave of Trwyn Swch.&mdash;This is the
first indication which I have discovered, that the fairies are addicted
to smoking.</p>
<p>P. <a href="#v2pb506" class="pageref">506</a>. A <i>Rhiw
Gyferthwch</i> (printed <i>Rywgyverthwch</i>) occurs in the <i>Record
of Carnarvon</i>, p. 200; but it seems to have been in Merionethshire,
and far enough from Arfon.</p>
<p>P. <a href="#v2pb521" class="pageref">521</a>. In the article
already cited from the <i>Romania</i>, M. Paris finds Twrch Trwyth in
the boar <i>Tortain</i> of a French romance: see xxviii. 217, where he
mentions a legend concerning the strange pedigree of that beast. The
subject requires to be further studied.</p>
<p>P. <a href="#v2pb535" class="pageref">535</a>. A less probable
explanation of <i>Latio</i> would be to suppose <i>orti</i> understood.
This has been suggested to me by Mr. Nicholson&rsquo;s treatment of the
&#7930;anaelhaiarn inscription as <i>Ali ortus Elmetiaco hic iacet</i>,
where I should regard <i>Ali</i> as standing for an earlier nominative
<i>Alec-s</i>, and intended as the Celtic equivalent for <i>Cephas</i>
or <i>Peter</i>: <i>Ali</i> would be the word which is in Med. Irish
<i>ail</i>, genitive <i>ailech</i>, &lsquo;a rock or stone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>P. <a href="#v2pb545" class="pageref">545</a>. We have the
<i>Maethwy</i> of Gilvaethwy possibly still further reduced to
<i>Aethwy</i> in <i>Porth Aethwy</i>, &lsquo;the Village of Menai
Bridge,&rsquo; in spite of its occurring in the <i>Record of
Carnarvon</i>, p. 77, as <i>Porthaytho</i>.</p>
<p>P. <a href="#v2pb548" class="pageref">548</a>. To the reference to
the <i>Cymmrodor</i>, ix. 170, as to Beli being called son of Anna, add
the Welsh <i>Elucidarium</i>, p. 127, with its <i>belim vab anna</i>,
and <i>The Cambro-British Saints</i>, p. 82, where we have <i>Anna
&hellip; genuit Beli</i>.</p>
<p>P. <a href="#v2pb560" class="pageref">560</a>. Two answers to the
query as to the <i>&#7930;ech Las</i> are now to be found in the

<p>P. <a href="#v2pb566" class="pageref">566</a>. Caer Gai is called
also <i>Caer Gynyr</i>, after Cai&rsquo;s father Cynyr, to wit in a
poem by William &#7930;eyn, who died in 1587. This I owe to Professor
J. Morris Jones, who has copied it from a collection of that
poet&rsquo;s works in the possession of Myr&#273;in Far&#273;, fo. 119.

<p>P. <a href="#v2pb569" class="pageref">569</a>. Here it would,
perhaps, not be irrelevant to mention <i>Caer &#272;wrgynt</i>, given
s. v. <i>Dwr</i> in Morris&rsquo; <i>Celtic Remains</i>, as a name of
<i>Caergybi</i>, or Holyhead. His authority is given in parenthesis
thus: (Th. Williams, <i>Catal</i>.). I should be disposed to think the
name based on some such an earlier form as <i>Kair D&#7933;bgint</i>,
&lsquo;the Fortress of the Danes,&rsquo; who were called in old Welsh
<i>Dub-gint</i> (<i>Annales Cambri&aelig;</i>, <span class="sc">A.
D.</span> 866, in the <i>Cymmrodor</i>, ix. 165), that is to say
&lsquo;<i>Gentes Nigr&aelig;</i> or Black Pagans,&rsquo; and more
simply <i>Gint</i> or <i>Gynt</i>, &lsquo;<i>Gentes</i> or
Heathens.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Pp. <a href="#v2pb579" class="pageref">579</a>&ndash;80. The word
<i>banna&#7933;c</i>, whence the later <i>bannog</i>, seems to be the
origin of the name <i>bonoec</i> given to the famous horn in the <i>Lai
du Corn</i>, from which M. Paris in his <i>Romania</i> article, xxviii.
229, cites <i>Cest cor qui bonoec a non</i>, &lsquo;this horn which is
called <i>bonoec</i>.&rsquo; The Welsh name would have to be <i>Corn
(yr) ych banna&#7933;c</i>, &lsquo;the horn of (the) <i>bannog</i>
ox,&rsquo; with or without the article.</p>
<p>P. <a href="#v2pb580" class="pageref">580</a>, note 1. One of the
Liverpool Eiste&#273;fod competitors cites W. O. Pughe to the following
effect in Welsh:&mdash;<i>&#7930;yn dau Ychain</i>, &lsquo;the Lake of
Two Oxen,&rsquo; is on Hiraethog Mountain; and near it is the footmark
of one of them in a stone or rock (<i>carreg</i>), where he rested when
seeking his partner, as the local legend has it. Another cites a still
wilder story, to the effect that there was once a wonderful cow called
<i>Y Fuwch Fraith</i>, &lsquo;the Parti-coloured Cow.&rsquo; &lsquo;To
that cow there came a witch to get milk, just after the cow had
supplied the whole neighbourhood. So the witch could not get any milk,
and to avenge her disappointment she made the cow mad. The result was
that the cow ran wild over the mountains, inflicting immense harm on
the country; but at last she was killed by Hu near Hiraethog, in the
county of Denbigh.&rsquo;</p>
<p>P. <a href="#v2pb592" class="pageref">592</a>. With <i>trwtan</i>,
<i>Trwtyn-Tratyn</i>, and <i>Trit-a-trot</i> should doubtless be
compared the English use of <i>trot</i> as applied contemptuously to a
woman, as when Grumio, in Shakespeare&rsquo;s <i>Taming of the
Shrew</i>, Act i, sc. 2, speaks of &lsquo;an old <i>trot</i> with
ne&rsquo;er a tooth in her head&rsquo;: the word was similarly used by
Thomas Heywood and others.</p>
<p>P. <a href="#v2pb649" class="pageref">649</a>. With regard to note
1, I find that Professor Zimmer is of opinion&mdash;in fact he is quite
positive&mdash;that <i>tyngu</i> and <i>tynghed</i> are in no way
related: see the <i lang="de">G&ouml;ttingische gelehrte Anzeigen</i>
for 1900 (No. 5), pp. 371&ndash;2.</p>
<p>P. <a href="#v2pb673" class="pageref">673</a>. I am tempted to rank
with the man-eating fairies the Atecotti, who are known to have been
cannibals, and whose name seems to mean the <i>ancient</i> race. Should
this prove tenable, one would have to admit that the little people, or
at any rate peoples with an admixture of the blood of that race, could
be trained to fight. Further, one would probably have to class with
them also such non-cannibal tribes as those of the Fir Bolg and the
Gali&uacute;in of Irish story. Information about both will be found in
my <i>Hibbert Lectures</i>, in reading which, however, the mythological
speculations should be brushed aside. Lastly, I anticipate that most of
the peoples figuring in the oldest class of Irish story will prove to
have belonged either (1) to the dwarf race, or (2) to the Picts; and
that careful reading will multiply the means of distinguishing between
them. Looking comprehensively at the question of the early races of the
British Isles, the reader should weigh again the concluding words of
Professor Haddon&rsquo;s theory, quoted on p. 684 above. <span class=
